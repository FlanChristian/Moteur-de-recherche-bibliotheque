characters in the play

geoffrey chilvers, m.p.             a loving husband, and (would-be)
(_president mens league for the    affectionate father.  like many
extension of the franchise to       other good men, he is in sympathy
women_)                             with the womans movement: not
                                    thinking it is coming in his
                                    time.
annys chilvers (_nee mogton_,       a loving wife, and (would-be)
_hon. sec. womens parliamentary    affection mother.  many thousands
franchise league_)                  of years have gone to her making.
                                    a generation ago, she would have
                                    been the ideal woman: the ideal
                                    helpmeet.  but new ideas are
                                    stirring in her blood, a new
                                    ideal of womanhood is forcing
                                    itself upon her.
lady mogton (_president             she knows she would be of more
w.p.f.l._)                          use in parliament than many of
                                    the men who are there; is
                                    naturally annoyed at the laws
                                    stupidity in keeping her out.
phoebe mogton (_org. sec.           the new girl, thinking more of
w.p.f.l._)                          politics than of boys.  but that
                                    will probably pass.
janet blake (_jt. org. sec.         she dreams of a new heaven and a
w.p.f.l._)                          new earth when woman has the
                                    vote.
mrs. mountcalm villiers             she was getting tired of
(_vice-president w.p.f.l._)         flirting.  the womans movement
                                    has arrived just at the right
                                    moment.
elizabeth spender (_hons. treas.    she sees woman everywhere the
w.p.f.l._)                          slave of man: now pampered, now
                                    beaten, but ever the slave.  she
                                    can see no hope of freedom but
                                    through warfare.

                                    have no message so far as

                                    and who has to reconcile herself
                                    to the fact that so far as her
                                    class is concerned the primval
                                    laws still run.

                                    people is still to be discovered.




the first act


scene:_drawing-room_, 91, _russell square_.

                            time:_afternoon_.

(mrs. elizabeth spender _sits near the fire_, _reading a book_.  _she is
a tall_, _thin woman_, _with passionate eyes_, _set in an oval face of
olive complexion_; _the features are regular and severe_; _her massive
dark hair is almost primly arranged_.  _she wears a tailor-made costume_,
_surmounted by a plain black hat_.  _the door opens and_ phoebe _enters_,
_shown in by_ hake, _the butler_, _a thin_, _ascetic-looking man of about
thirty_, _with prematurely grey hair_.  phoebe mogton _is of the fluffy
ruffles type_, _petite_, _with a retrousse nose_, _remarkably bright
eyes_, _and a quantity of fluffy light hair_, _somewhat untidily
arranged_.  _she is fashionably dressed in the fussy_, _flyaway style_.
elizabeth _looks up_; _the two young women shake hands_.)

phoebe.  good woman.  tisnt three oclock yet, is it?

elizabeth.  about five minutes to.

phoebe.  annys is on her way.  i just caught her in time.  (_to_ hake.)
put a table and six chairs.  give mamma a hammer and a cushion at her
back.

hake.  a hammer, miss?

phoebe.  a chairmans hammer.  havent you got one?

hake.  im afraid not, miss.  would a gravy spoon do?

phoebe (_to_ elizabeth, _after expression of disgust_.)  fancy a house
without a chairmans hammer!  (_to_ hake.)  see that theres something.
did your wife go to the meeting last night?

hake (_he is arranging furniture according to instructions_.)  im not
quite sure, miss.  i gave her the evening out.

phoebe.  gave her the evening out!

elizabeth.  we are speaking of your wife, man, not your servant.

hake.  yes, miss.  you see, we dont keep servants in our class.
somebodys got to put the children to bed.

elizabeth.  why not the manoccasionally?

hake.  well, you see, miss, in my case, i rarely getting home much before
midnight, it would make it so late.  yesterday being my night off, things
fitted in, so to speak.  will there be any writing, miss?

phoebe.  yes.  see that theres plenty of blotting-paper.  (_to_
elizabeth.)  mamma always splashes so.

hake.  yes, miss.

                                                          (_he goes out_.)

elizabeth.  did you ever hear anything more delightfully naive?  he
gave her the evening out.  thats how they think of usas their
servants.  the gentleman hasnt the courage to be straightforward about
it.  the butler blurts out the truth.  why are we meeting here instead of
at our own place?

phoebe.  for secrecy, i expect.  too many gasbags always about the
office.  i fancyim not quite surethat mammas got a new idea.

elizabeth.  leading to holloway?

phoebe.  well, most roads lead there.

elizabeth.  and end thereso far as i can see.

phoebe.  youre too impatient.

elizabeth.  its what our friends have been telling usfor the last fifty
years.

phoebe.  look here, if it was only the usual sort of thing mamma wouldnt
want it kept secret.  im inclined to think its a new departure
altogether.

  (_the door opens_.  _there enters_ janet blake, _followed by_ hake,
  _who proceeds with his work_.  janet blake _is a slight_,
  _fragile-looking creature_, _her great dark eyesthe eyes of a
  fanaticemphasise the pallor of her childish face_.  _she is shabbily
  dressed_; _a plain_, _uninteresting girl until she smiles_, _and then
  her face becomes quite beautiful_.  phoebe _darts to meet her_.)  good
  girl.  was afraidi say, youre wet through.

janet.  it was only a shower.  the buses were all full.  i had to ride
outside.

phoebe.  silly kid, why didnt you take a cab?

janet.  ive been reckoning it up.  ive been half over london chasing
mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  cabs would have come, at the very least, to
twelve-and-six.

phoebe.  well

janet (_to_ elizabeth.)  welli want you to put me down as a contributor
for twelve-and-six.  (_she smiles_.)  its the only way i can give.

phoebe.  (_she is taking off_ janets _cloak_; _throws it to_ hake.)
have this put somewhere to dry.  (_she pushes_ janet _to the fire_.)  get
near the fire.  youre as cold as ice.

elizabeth.  all the seats inside, i suppose, occupied by the chivalrous
sex.

janet.  oh, there was one young fellow offered to give me up his place,
but i wouldnt let him.  you see, were claiming equality.  (_smiles_.)

elizabeth.  and are being granted itin every direction where it works to
the convenience of man.

phoebe.  (_laughs_.)  is she comingthe villiers woman?

janet.  yes.  i ran her down at lastat her dress-makers.  she made an
awful fuss about it, but i wouldnt leave till shed promised.  tell me,
its something quite important, isnt it?

phoebe.  i dont know anything, except that i had an urgent telegram from
mamma this morning to call a meeting of the entire council here at three
oclock.  shes coming up from manchester on purpose.  (_to_ hake.)  mrs.
chilvers hasnt returned yet, has she?

hake.  not yet, miss.  shall i telephone

phoebe.  (_shakes her head_.)  no; its all right.  i have seen her.  let
her know we are here the moment she comes in.

hake.  yes, miss.

  (_he has finished the arrangements_.  _the table has been placed in the
  centre of the room_, _six chairs round it_, _one of them being a large
  armchair_.  _he has placed writing materials and a large silver gravy
  spoon_.  _he is going_.)

phoebe.  why arent you sure your wife wasnt at the meeting last night?
didnt she say anything?

hake.  well, miss, unfortunately, just as she was starting, mrs.
comerfordthats the wife of the party that keeps the shop
downstairslooked in with an order for the theatre.

phoebe.  oh!

hake.  so i thought it best to ask no questions.

phoebe.  thank you.

hake.  thank you, miss.

                                                          (_he goes out_.)

elizabeth.  can nothing be done to rouse the working-class woman out of
her apathy?

phoebe.  well, if you ask me, i think a good deal has been done.

elizabeth.  oh, whats the use of our deceiving ourselves?  the great
mass are utterly indifferent.

janet (_she is seated in an easy-chair near the fire_.)  i was talking to
a woman only yesterdayin bethnal green.  she keeps a husband and three
children by taking in washing.  lord, miss, she laughed, what would we
do with the vote if we did have it?  only one thing more to give to the
men.

phoebe.  thats rather good.

elizabeth.  the curse of it is that its true.  why should they put
themselves out merely that one man instead of another should dictate
their laws to them?

phoebe.  my dear girl, precisely the same argument was used against the
second reform bill.  what earthly difference could it make to the working
men whether tory squire or liberal capitalist ruled over them?  that was
in 1868.  to-day, fifty-four labour members sit in parliament.  at the
next election they will hold the balance.

elizabeth.  ah, if we could only hold out _that_ sort of hope to them!

  (annys _enters_.  _she is in outdoor costume_.  _she kisses_ phoebe,
  _shakes hands with the other two_.  annyss _age is about twenty-five_.
  _she is a beautiful_, _spiritual-looking creature_, _tall and
  graceful_, _with a manner that is at the same time appealing and
  commanding_.  _her voice is soft and caressing_, _but capable of
  expressing all the emotions_.  _her likeness to her younger sister_
  phoebe _is of the slightest_: _the colouring is the same_, _and the
  eyes that can flash_, _but there the similarity ends_.  _she is simply
  but well dressed_.  _her soft hair makes a quiet but wonderfully
  effective frame to her face_.)

annys.  (_she is taking off her outdoor things_.)  hope im not late.  i
had to look in at caxton house.  why are we holding it here?

phoebe.  mammas instructions.  cant tell you anything more except that
i gather the matters important, and is to be kept secret.

annys.  mamma isnt here, is she?

phoebe.  (_shakes her head_.)  reaches st. pancras at two-forty.  (_looks
at her watch_.)  trains late, i expect.

                          (hake _has entered_.)

annys.  (_she hands_ hake _her hat and coat_.)  have something ready in
case lady mogton hasnt lunched.  is your master in?

hake.  a messenger came for him soon after you left, maam.  i was to
tell you he would most likely be dining at the house.

annys.  thank you.

                            (hake _goes out_.)

annys.  (_to_ elizabeth.)  i so want you to meet geoffrey.  hell alter
your opinion of men.

elizabeth.  my opinion of men has been altered once or twiceeach time
for the worse.

annys.  why do you dislike men?

elizabeth.  (_with a short laugh_.)  why does the slave dislike the
slave-owner?

phoebe.  oh, come off the perch.  you spend five thousand a year provided
for you by a husband that you only see on sundays.  wed all be slaves at
that price.

elizabeth.  the chains have always been stretched for the few.  my
sympathies are with my class.

annys.  but men like geoffreymen who are devoting their whole time and
energy to furthering our cause; what can you have to say against them?

elizabeth.  simply that they dont know what theyre doing.  the french
revolution was nursed in the salons of the french nobility.  when the
true meaning of the womans movement is understood we shall have to get
on without the male sympathiser.

                               (_a pause_.)

annys.  what do you understand is the true meaning of the womans
movement?

elizabeth.  the dragging down of man from his position of supremacy.
what else can it mean?

annys.  something much better.  the lifting up of woman to be his
partner.

elizabeth.  my dear annys, the men who to-day are advocating votes for
women are doing so in the hope of securing obedient supporters for their
own political schemes.  in new zealand the working man brings his female
relations in a van to the poll, and sees to it that they vote in
accordance with his orders.  when man once grasps the fact that woman is
not going to be his henchman, but his rival, men and women will face one
another as enemies.

  (_the door opens_.  hake _announces_ lady mogton _and_ dorian st.
  herbert.  lady mogton _is a large_, _strong-featured woman_, _with a
  naturally loud voice_.  _she is dressed with studied carelessness_.
  dorian st. herbert, k.c., _is a tall_, _thin man_, _about thirty_.  _he
  is elegantly_, _almost dandily dressed_.)

annys.  (_kissing her mother_.)  have you had lunch?

lady mogton.  in the train.

phoebe.  (_who has also kissed her mother and shaken hands with_ st.
herbert.)  we are all here except villiers.  shes coming.  did you have
a good meeting?

lady mogton.  fairly.  some young fool had chained himself to a pillar
and thrown the key out of window.

phoebe.  what did you do?

lady mogton.  tied a sack over his head and left him there.

  (_she turns aside for a moment to talk to_ st. herbert, _who has taken
  some papers from his despatch-box_.)

annys.  (_to_ elizabeth.)  we must finish out our talk some other time.
you are quite wrong.

elizabeth.  perhaps.

lady mogton.  we had better begin.  i have only got half an hour.

janet.  i saw mrs. villiers.  she promised shed come.

lady mogton.  you should have told her we were going to be photographed.
then shed have been punctual.  (_she has taken her seat at the table_.
st. herbert _at her right_.)  better put another chair in case she does
turn up.

janet.  (_does so_.)  shall i take any notes?

lady mogton.  no.  (_to_ annys.)  give instructions that we are not to be
interrupted for anything.

                          (annys _rings bell_.)

st. herbert.  (_he turns to_ phoebe, _on his right_.)  have you heard the
latest?

    _there was an old man of hong kong_,
    _whose language was terribly strong_.

  (_enter_ hake.  _he brings a bottle and glass_, _which he places_.)

annys.  oh, hake, please, dont let us be interrupted for anything.  if
mrs. mountcalm-villiers comes, show her up.  but nobody else.

hake.  yes, maam.

                                                        (hake _goes out_.)

st. herbert.  (_continuing_.)

    _it wasnt the words_
    _that frightened the birds_,
    _twas the orrible double-entendre_.

lady mogton.  (_who has sat waiting in grim silence_.)  have you
finished?

st. herbert.  quite finished.

lady mogton.  thank you.  (_she raps for silence_.)  you will understand,
please, all, that this is a private meeting of the council.  nothing that
transpires is to be allowed to leak out.  (_there is a murmur_.)
silence, please, for mr. st. herbert.

st. herbert.  before we begin, i should like to remind you, ladies, that
you are, all of you, persons mentally deficient

  (_the door opens_.  mrs. mountcalm-villiers _enters_, _announced by_
  hake.  _she is a showily-dressed_, _flamboyant lady_.)

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  i _am_ so sorry.  i have only just this
minute(_she catches sight of_ st. herbert.)  you naughty creature, why
werent you at my meeting last night?  the rajah came with both his
wives.  weve elected them, all three, honorary members.

lady mogton.  do you mind sitting down?

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  here, dear?  (_she takes the vacant chair_.)
so nice of you.  i read about your meeting.  what a clever idea!

lady mogton.  (_cuts her short_.)  yes.  we are here to consider a very
important matter.  by way of commencement mr. st. herbert has just
reminded us that in the eye of the law all women are imbeciles.

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  i know, dear.  isnt it shocking?

st. herbert.  deplorable; but of course not your fault.  i mention it
because of its importance to the present matter.  under clause a of the
act for the better regulation, &c., &c., all persons mentally deficient
are debarred from becoming members of parliament.  the classification has
been held to include idiots, infants, and women.

               (_an interruption_.  lady mogton _hammers_.)

bearing this carefully in mind, we proceed.  (_he refers to his notes_.)
two years ago a bye-election took place for the south-west division of
belfast.

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  my dear, may i?  it has just occurred to me.
why do we never go to ireland?

lady mogton.  for various sufficient reasons.

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  so many of the irish members have expressed
themselves quite sympathetically.

lady mogton.  we wish them to continue to do so.  (_turns to_ st.
herbert.)  im sorry.

st. herbert.  a leader of the orange party was opposed by a nationalist,
and the proceedings promised to be lively.  they promised for a while to
be still livelier, owing to the nomination at the last moment of the
local lunatic.

phoebe.  (_to_ annys.)  this is where we come in.

st. herbert.  there is always a local lunatic, who, if harmless, is
generally a popular character.  james washington mccaw appears to have
been a particularly cheerful specimen.  one of his eccentricities was to
always have a skipping-rope in his pocket; wherever the traffic allowed
it, he would go through the streets skipping.  he said it kept him warm.
another of his tricks was to let off fireworks from the roof of his house
whenever he heard of the death of anybody of importance.  the returning
officer refused his nominationwhich, so far as his nominators were
concerned, was intended only as a jokeon the grounds of his being by
common report a person of unsound mind.  and there, so far as south-west
belfast was concerned, the matter ended.

phoebe.  pity.

st. herbert.  but not so far as the returning officer was concerned.
mccaw appears to have been a lunatic possessed of means, imbued with all
an irishmans love of litigation.  he at once brought an action against
the returning officer, his contention being that his mental state was a
private matter, of which the returning officer was not the person to
judge.

phoebe.  he wasnt a lunatic all over.

st. herbert.  we none of us are.  the case went from court to court.  in
every instance the decision was in favour of the returning officer.
until it reached the house of lords.  the decision was given yesterday
afternoonin favour of the man mccaw.

elizabeth.  then lunatics, at all events, are not debarred from going to
the poll.

st. herbert.  the mentally deficient are no longer debarred from going
to the poll.

elizabeth.  what grounds were given for the decision?

st. herbert.  (_he refers again to his notes_.)  a returning officer can
only deal with objections arising out of the nomination paper.  he has no
jurisdiction to go behind a nomination paper and constitute himself a
court of inquiry as to the fitness or unfitness of a candidate.

phoebe.  good old house of lords!

                         (lady mogton _hammers_.)

elizabeth.  but i thought it was part of the returning officers duty to
inquire into objections, that a special time was appointed to deal with
them.

st. herbert.  he will still be required to take cognisance of any
informality in the nomination paper or papers.  beyond that, this
decision relieves him of all further responsibility.

janet.  but this gives us everything.

st. herbert.  it depends upon what you call everything.  it gives a woman
the right to go to the polla right which, as a matter of fact, she has
always possessed.

phoebe.  then why did the returning officer for camberwell in 1885

st. herbert.  because he did not know the law.  and miss helen taylor had
not the means possessed by our friend mccaw to teach it to him.

annys.  (_rises_.  _she goes to the centre of the room_.)

lady mogton.  where are you going?

annys.  (_she turns_; _there are tears in her eyes_.  _the question seems
to recall her to herself_.)  nowhere.  i am so sorry.  i cant help it.
it seems to me to mean so much.  it gives us the right to go before the
peopleto plead to them, not for ourselves, for them.  (_again she seems
to lose consciousness of those at the table_, _of the room_.)  to the men
we will say: will you not trust us?  is it harm we have ever done you?
have we not suffered for you and with you?  were we not sent into the
world to be your helpmeet?  are not the children ours as well as yours?
shall we not work together to shape the world where they must dwell?  is
it only the mother-voice that shall not be heard in your councils?  is it
only the mother-hand that shall not help to guide?  to the women we will
say: tell themtell them it is from no love of ourselves that we come
from our sheltered homes into the street.  it is to give, not to getto
mingle with the sterner judgments of men the deeper truths that god,
through pain, has taught to womento mingle with mans justice womans
pity, till there shall arise the perfect lawnot made of man nor woman,
but of both, each bringing what the other lacks.  and they will listen
to us.  till now it has seemed to them that we were clamouring only for
selfish ends.  they have not understood.  we shall speak to them of
common purposes, use the language of fellow-citizens.  they will see that
we are worthy of the place we claim.  they will welcome us as helpers in
a common cause.  they

              (_she turns__the present comes back to her_.)

lady mogton.  (_after a pause_.)  the business (_she dwells severely on
the word_) before the meeting

annys.  (_she resents herself meekly_.  _apologising generally_.)  i
_must_ learn to control myself.

lady mogton.  (_who has waited_.)  is mccaw versus potts.  its bearing
upon the movement for the extension of the franchise to women.  my own
view i venture to submit in the form of a resolution.  (_she takes up a
paper on which she has been writing_.)  as follows: that the council of
the womans parliamentary franchise league, having regard to the decision
of the house of lords in mccaw v. potts

st. herbert.  (_looking over_.)  two ts.

lady mogton.  resolves to bring forward a woman candidate to contest the
next bye-election.  (_suddenly to_ mrs. mountcalm-villiers, _who is
chattering_.)  do you agree or disagree?

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  my dear!  how can you ask?  of course we all
agree.  (_to elizabeth_.) you agree, dont you?

elizabeth.  of course, even if elected, she would not be allowed to take
her seat.

phoebe.  how do you know?  nothing more full of surprises than english
law.

lady mogton.  at the present stage i regard that point as immaterial.
what i am thinking of is the advertisement.  a female candidate upon the
platform will concentrate the whole attention of the country on our
movement.

st. herbert.  it might even be prudentuntil you have got the voteto
keep it dark that you will soon be proceeding to the next inevitable
step.

elizabeth.  you think even man could be so easily deceived!

st. herbert.  man has had so much practice in being deceived.  it comes
naturally to him.

elizabeth.  poor devil!

lady mogton.  the only question remaining to be discussed is the
candidate.

annys.  is there not danger that between now and the next bye-election
the government may, having regard to this case, bring in a bill to stop
women candidates from going to the poll?

st. herbert.  i have thought of that.  fortunately, the case seems to
have attracted very little attention.  if a bye-election occurred soon
there would hardly be time.

lady mogton.  it must be the very next one that does occurwherever it
is.

janet.  i am sure that in the east end we should have a chance.

phoebe.  great scott!  just think.  if we were to win it!

st. herbert.  if you could get a straight fight against a liberal i
believe you would.

annys.  why is the government so unpopular?

st. herbert.  well, take the weather alonetwelve degrees of frost again
last night.

janet.  in st. georges road the sewer has burst.  the water is in the
rooms where the children are sleeping.  (_she clenches her hands_.)

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  (_she shakes her head_.)  something ought
really to be done.

lady mogton.  has anybody any suggestion to make?as regards the
candidate.  theres no advantage in going outside.  it will have to be
one of ourselves.

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  wont you, dear?

lady mogton.  i shall be better employed organising.  my own feeling is
that it ought to be annys.  (_to_ st. herbert.)  what do you think?

st. herbert.  undoubtedly.

annys.  id rather not.

lady mogton.  its not a question of liking.  its a question of duty.
for this occasion we shall be appealing to the male voter.  our candidate
must be a woman popular with men.  the choice is somewhat limited.

elizabeth.  no one will put up so good a fight as you.

annys.  will you give me till this evening?

lady mogton.  what for?

annys.  i should like to consult geoffrey.

lady mogton.  you think he would object?

annys.  (_a little doubtfully_.)  no.  but we have always talked
everything over together.

lady mogton.  absurd!  hes one of our staunchest supporters.  of course
hell be delighted.

elizabeth.  i think the thing ought to be settled at once.

lady mogton.  it must be.  i have to return to manchester to-night.  we
shall have to get to work immediately.

st. herbert.  geoffrey will surely take it as a compliment.

janet.  dont you feel that woman, all over the world, is calling to you?

annys.  it isnt that.  im not trying to shirk it.  i merely thought
that if there had been timeof course, if you really think

lady mogton.  you consent?

annys.  yes.  if its everybodys wish.

lady mogton.  thats settled.

phoebe.  (_she springs up_, _waving a handkerchief_.)  chilvers for ever!

janet.  (_rises_.)  god bless you!

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  (_clapping her hands_.)  now we shant be long!

lady mogton.  (_hammers_.)  order, please!

                          (_the three subside_.)

this is serious business.  the next step is, of course

  (_the door opens_; geoffrey _enters_.  _he is a youngish-looking man of
  three or four and thirty_.  lady mogton, _at the sound of the door_,
  _turns_.  st. herbert _rises_.  _there is a pause_.)

lady mogton.  weve been talking about you.  we must apologise for
turning your drawing-room

geoffrey.  my dear mother-in-law, it is providence.  (_he kisses her_.)
there is no one i was more longing to see.

annys.  (_she has risen_.)  hake told me you would be dining at the
house.

geoffrey.  (_he comes to her_, _kisses her_, _he is in a state of
suppressed excitement_.)  i shall be.  i came back to bring you some
news.

phoebe.  weve got some news for you.  have you heard

geoffrey.  (_he stays her_.)  may i claim mans privilege for the first
word?  it is news, i am sure, you will all be delighted to hear.  a
friend of yours has been appointed to an office whereit is quite
possiblehe may be of service to you.

phoebe.  governorship of holloway gaol?

geoffrey.  not a bad guess.  very near it.  to the under-secretaryship
for home affairs.

lady mogton.  who is it?

geoffrey.  (_he bows_.)  your affectionate and devoted servant.

annys.  you!

phoebe.  (_genuinely delighted_.  _she is not a quick thinker_.)  bravo!
congratulations, old boy!  (_she has risen__she slaps him on the back_.)

annys.  geoffrey!  (_she puts her arms about him_.)  you never told me
anything.

geoffrey.  i know, dear.  i was afraid.  it mightnt have come off.  and
then you would have been so disappointed.

annys.  (_there are tears in her eyes_.  _she still clings to him_.)  i
am so glad.  oh, i am so glad!

geoffrey.  it is all your doing.  you have been such a splendid help.
(_he breaks gently away from her_.  _turns to_ st. herbert, _with a
lighter tone_.)  havent you anything to say to a fellow?  youre not
usually dumb.

st. herbert.  it has all been so suddenas the early victorian heroine
was fond of remarking!

geoffrey.  (_laughs_.)  it has been sudden.  we had, none of us, any idea
till yesterday that old bullock was thinking of resigning.

elizabeth.  (_she has risen and moved towards the fire_.)  wont it
necessitate a bye-election?

  (lady mogton _and_ st. herbert _have been thinking it out_.  _on the
  others the word falls like a bombshell_.)

geoffrey.  (_he turns to her_.  _he does not see their faces_.)  yes.
but i dont anticipate a contest.  the conservatives are without a
candidate, and i am on good terms with the labour party.  perhaps mr.
hunnable(_he laughs_, _then_, _turning_, _catches sight of his wifes
face_.  _from_ annys _he looks to the others_.)

lady mogton.  (_she has risen_.)  you havent heard, then, of mccaw
versus potts?

geoffrey.  mccaw versus potts!  what the

st. herbert.  was decided in the house of lords late yesterday afternoon.
briefly stated, it confers upon women the right of becoming parliamentary
candidates.

geoffrey.  (_he is staggered_.)  you mean

lady mogton.  having regard to which, we have decided to bring forward a
woman candidate to contest the next bye-election.

geoffrey.  um!  i see.

annys.  but we never thoughtwe never anticipated it would be geoffreys.

lady mogton.  i really cannot admit that that alters the case.  geoffrey
himself would never dream, i am sure, of asking us to sacrifice our cause
to his convenience.

geoffrey.  no.  of course not.  certainly not.

lady mogton.  it is perhaps unfortunate that the candidate selected

annys.  it is quite impossible.  such a dilemma was never dreamed of.

lady mogton.  and if not?  is the solidarity of woman

geoffrey.  (_beginning to guess_.)  forgive my impatience; but whom
_have_ you selected?

elizabeth.  (_when she likes she can be quite sweet_.)  your wife.  (_he
expected it_.)  we rather assumed (_she appeals to the others with a
gesture_), i think, that the president of the mans league for the
extension of the franchise to women would regard it as a compliment.

geoffrey.  (_his dislike of her is already in existence_.)  yes.  very
thoughtful.

annys.  you must choose some one else.

phoebe.  but there _is_ no one else.

annys.  theres mamma.

phoebe.   mammas too heavy.

annys.  well, then, theres elizabeththeres you!

geoffrey.  yes.  why not you?  you and i could have a jolly little fight.

lady mogton.  this is not a laughing matter.  if i could think of any one
to take annyss place i should not insist.  i cannot.

phoebe.  you see, it mustnt be a crank.

geoffrey.  (_he is losing his temper_.)  yes, i suppose that does limit
you.

elizabeth.  and thenthanks to youmrs. chilvers has had such excellent
training in politics.  it was that, i think, that decided us.

geoffrey.  (_convention forbids his strangling her_.)  will somebody
kindly introduce me to this lady?

st. herbert.  ah, yes, of course.  you dont know each other, do you?
mr. geoffrey chilversmrs. joseph spender.  mrs. spendermr. chilvers,
m.p.

elizabeth.  (_sweetly_.)  delighted!

geoffrey.  (_not_.)  charmed.

lady mogton.  (_to_ annys.)  i am not indifferent to your difficulty.
but the history of woman, my dear annys, is a history of sacrifice.  we
give our sonsif necessary, our husbands.

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  (_affected_.)  how true!

annys.  but you are not asking me to give him.  you are asking me to
fight him.  i cant.

lady mogton.  you mean you wont.

annys.  you can put it that way if you like.  i wont.

                               (_a pause_.)

janet.  i thought mrs. chilvers had pledged her word.

elizabeth.  yes.  but without her husbands consent.  so, of course, it
doesnt count.

geoffrey.  (_he turns on her_.)  why not youif there must be a fight?
or would it be against your principles?

elizabeth.  not in the least.

geoffrey.  ah!

elizabeth.  i would offer myself as a substitute.  only it might seem
like coming between husband and wife.

geoffrey.  (_he turns away with a grunt of disgust_.)

phoebe.  its awfully rough on you, geoffrey.  i can see it from your
point of view.  but one cant help remembering the things that you
yourself have said.

geoffrey.  i know; i know.  ive been going up and down the country,
excusing even your excesses on the ground that no movement can force its
way to the front without treading on innumerable toes.  for me, now, to
cry halt merely because it happens to be my own toes that are in the way
would beridiculousabsurdwould be monstrous.  (_nobody contradicts
him_.)  you are perfectly justifiedif this case means what you say it
doesin putting up a candidate against me for east poplar.  only,
naturally, it cannot be annys.  (_he reaches out his hand to where_ annys
_stands a little behind him_, _takes her hand_.)  annys and i have fought
more than one election.  it has been side by side.

elizabeth.  the lady a little behind.

geoffrey.  (_he moves away with an expression of deep annoyance_.)

janet.  (_she comes forward_.  _she holds forth her hands with a
half-appealing_, _half-commanding gesture_.  _she almost seems
inspired_.)  would it not be so much better if, in this first political
contest between man and woman, the opponents were two people honouring
one another, loving one another?  would it not show to all the world that
man and woman may meetcontend in public life without anger, without
scorn?  (_there is a pause_.  _they stand listening_.)  i do not know,
but it seems to me that if mr. chilvers could bring himself to do this it
would be such a big thingperhaps the most chivalrous thing that a man
has ever done to help women.  if he would put aside, quite voluntarily,
all the mans privilegejust say to the people, now chooseone of us two
to serve you.  we stand before you, equal, my wife and i.  i dont know
how to put it, but i feel that by merely doing that one thing mr.
chilvers would solve the whole problem.  it would prove that good men are
ready to give us of their free accord all that we claim.  we should gain
our rights, not by warfare, but through love and understanding.  wouldnt
that beso much better?  (_she looksher hands still appealingfrom one
to the other_.)

  (_another silence_.  _they have all been carried a little off their
  feet by_ janets _earnestness_.)

annys.  (_she touches him_.)  what do you think, dear?

geoffrey.  yes, theres a good deal, of course, in what miss blake says.

annys.  it _would_ be a big thing for you to do.

phoebe.  you see, whatever happened, the seat would be yours.  this case
only gives us the right to go to the poll.  we are keen upon annys
because shes our best card, thats all.

geoffrey.  do you wish it?

annys.  (_she smiles up at him_.)  id rather fight you than any one
else.

geoffrey.  you are not afraid that the situation might bejust a trifle
comical?

annys.  (_shakes her head_.)  no.  i think everybody will say it was
rather splendid of you.

geoffrey.  well, if it will help women.

annys.  (_she holds out her hand_.  _she is still in exalted mood_.)  we
will show how man and woman may be drawn nearer to one another by rivalry
for noble ends.

st. herbert.  (_he shakes_ geoffreys _somewhat limp hand_.)  i envy you.
the situation promises to be piquant.

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  it will be a battle of roses.

lady mogton.  i must go.  i shall see you both again to-morrow.  (_she
kisses_ geoffrey.)  this is an historic day.

geoffrey.  yes.  i daresay we shall all remember it.

lady mogton.  (_to_ janet.)  i will get you to come to the station with
me.  i can give you your instructions in the cab.  (_she kisses_ annys.)
you have been called to a great work.  be worthy of it.

  (_they are all making ready to go_.  annys _has rung the bell for_
  hake.)

janet.  (_to_ annys.)  are you glad?

annys.  (_kisses her_.)  you showed me the whole thing in a new light.
you were splendid.  (_she turns to_ elizabeth.)  didnt i tell you he
would convert you?

elizabeth.  i was wrong to judge all men guilty.  there are alsothe
innocent.

annys.  (_for a momentbut a moment onlyshe is pleased_.  _then the
doubtful meaning of_ elizabeths _words strikes her_.)

                             (_enter_ hake.)

annys.  (_she has to dismiss_ elizabeth.)  oh, hake(_to_ lady mogton.)
youll want a cab, wont you, mamma?

lady mogton.  a taxi  goodbye, everybody.

                                                        (_she sails out_.)

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  i have my carriage.  (_to_ elizabeth.)  can i
give you a lift?

elizabeth.  thank you.  (_to_ geoffrey.)  we shall meet again.

geoffrey.  i feel sure of it.

  (mrs. mountcalm-villiers _and_ elizabeth _go out_.)

phoebe.  (_to_ hake.)  are miss blakes things dry yet?

janet.  theyll be quite all right, dear.  please dont trouble.  (_she
advances a timid hand to_ geoffrey.)  goodbye, mr. chilvers.

geoffrey.  (_he takes it smiling_.)  goodbye.

                    (_she goes out_; hake _follows_.)

phoebe.  goodbye, old boy.  (_they shake hands_.)  dont you let her walk
over you.  make her fight.

annys.  (_laughing_.)  dont you worry about that.

st. herbert.  would you care to look through mccaw v. potts?  (_he has
the papers in his hand_.)

geoffrey.  ill ask you for it when i want it.

phoebe.  (_at door_.)  youll be alone this evening?

annys.  yes.  come in to dinner.

phoebe.  all right.  goodbye.

st. herbert.  goodbye.

  (geoffrey _and_ annys _answer them_.  _they go out_, _closing the
  door_.  geoffrey _is by the fire_.  annys _comes to him_.)

annys.  (_she puts her arms round him_.)  you dont mind?

geoffrey.  (_he holds her at arms lengthlooking into her eyes and
smiling_.)  i believe you are looking forward to it.

annys.  do you know how long we have been married?  eight years.  and do
you know, sir, that all that time we have never had a difference?  dont
you think it will be good for you?

geoffrey.  do you know _why_ we have never had a difference?  because you
have always had your own way.

annys.  oh!

geoffrey.  you have got so used to it, you dont notice it.

annys.  then it will be good for me.  i must learn to suffer opposition.
(_she laughs_.)

geoffrey.  you wont like it.

annys.  do you know, im not at all sure that i shant.  (_unconsciously
they let loose of one another_.)  you see, i shall have the right of
hitting back.  (_again she laughs_.)

geoffrey.  (_also laughingly_.)  is woman going to develop the fighting
instinct?

annys.  i wonder.

                         (_a moments silence_.)

geoffrey.  the difficulty in our case is there seems nothing to fight
about.

annys.  we must think of something.  (_laughs_.)

geoffrey.  what line are you going to takewhat is your argument: why
they should vote for you in preference to me?

annys.  simply that i am a woman.

geoffrey.  my dear child, that wont be enough.  why should they vote for
you merely because youre a woman?

annys.  (_slightly astonished_.)  becausebecause women are wanted in
public life.

geoffrey.  who wants them?

annys.  (_more astonished_.)  who?  why(_it doesnt seem too clear_.)
why, all of usyou, yourself!

geoffrey.  im not east poplar.

annys.  (_is puzzled a moment_, _then valiantly_.)  i shall ask them to
send me to parliament to represent the interests of their womenand
therefore of themselvesthe interests of their children.

geoffrey.  children!  what do you know about children?

                           (_another silence_.)

annys.  personallyno.  we have had no children of our own, of course.
but (_hopefully_) it is a womans instinct.

geoffrey.  oh, lord!  thats what the lady said who had buried seven.

annys.  (_her mouth is growing hard_.)  dont you believe in the right of
women to share in the government of the country?

geoffrey.  some women.  yes.  i can see some capable

annys.  (_winces_.)

geoffrey.  elderly, motherly woman who has brought up a dozen children
of her ownwho knows the world, being of some real use.

annys.  if it comes to that, there must bei dont say more capable,
but more experienced, more fatherly men than yourself.

  (_he turns_, _they look at one another_.  _his tone almost touched
  contempthers was veiled anger_.)

geoffrey.  _thats_ the danger.  it may come to a real fight.

annys.  (_upon her also the fear has fallen_.)  it must not.  (_she
flings her arms around him_.)  we must show the world that man and woman
can meetcontend in public life without anger, without scorn.

geoffrey.  (_he folds her to him_.)  the very words sound ugly, dont
they?

annys.  it would be hideous.  (_she draws away_.)  how long will the
election last?

geoffrey.  not long.  the writ will be issued on wednesday.  nomination
on mondaypolling, i expect, on saturday.  puts me in mindi must prepare
my election address.

annys.  i ought to be getting on with mine, too, i suppose.

geoffrey.  it ought to be out by to-morrow.

annys.  (_with inspiration_.)  well do yours first.  (_she wonders why
he hesitates_.)

geoffrey.  we?  shant i have to do it alonethis time?

annys.  alone!  nonsense!  how can you?

geoffrey.  im afraid i shall have to try.

annys.  um!  i suppose youre right.  what a nuisance!  (_she turns
away_.)  i shant like it.

geoffrey.  (_he moves towards the folding-doors_.)  no.  it wont be
quite the same thing.  goodbye.

annys.  (_she crosses to her desk by the window_.  _not the same instant
but the next his_ _goodbye_ _strikes her_.  _she turns_.)  youre not
going out, are you?

geoffrey.  (_he stops and turnspuzzled at her question_.)  no.  only
into my study.

annys.  you said goodbye.

geoffrey.  (_not remembering_.)  _i_ did!  must have been thinking of
something else.  i shall be in here if you want me.  (_he goes into the
other room_.)

annys.  (_she has crossed to her desk_.  _she is humming_.  _she seats
herself_, _takes paper and pen_, _writes_.  _without turningstill
writingshe raises her voice_.)  geoffrey!  how do you spell
experimental?  one r or two?

  (_there is no answer_.  _puzzled at the silence_, _she looks round_.
  _the great folding-doors are closed_.  _she stares in front of her_,
  _thinking_, _then turns again to her work_.)

scene:_liberal central committee rooms_, _east india dock road_,
_poplar_.  _a large_, _high room on the first floor of an old-fashioned
house_.  _two high windows right_.  _a door at back is the main
entrance_.  _a door left leads to other rooms_.  _the walls are papered
with election literature_.  _conspicuous among the posters displayed is_
_a man for men_.  _no petticoat government_.  _will you be
henpecked_?  _a large_, _round table centre is littered with papers and
pamphlets_.  _a large desk stands between the windows_.  _a settee is
against the left wall_.

(_when the curtain rises_, rose merton (_otherwise_ ginger) _is
discovered seated_, _her left arm resting on the table_.  _she is a young
lady typical of the cockney slavey type_, _dressed according to the ideas
of her class as regards the perfect lady_.  _her hat is characteristic_.

_saucy__are displayed around her_.  _she is feeling comfortable and
airing her views_.  mrs. chinn _is laying the cloth over a portion of the
table_, _with some tea-things_.  mrs. chinn _is a thin_, _narrow-chested
lady with thin hands and bony wrists_.  _no one since her husband died
has ever seen her without her bonnet_.  _its appearance suggests the
possibility that she sleeps in it_.  _it is black_, _like her dress_.
_the whole figure is decent_, _but dingy_.)

ginger.  wot i say about the question is

mrs. chinn.  do you mind moving your arm?

ginger.  beg pardon.  (_she shifts_.)  wot i say is, why not give us the
vote and end all the talking?

mrs. chinn.  you think it would have that effect?

ginger.  well! we dont want to go on being a nuisancelonger than we can
possibly elp!

mrs. chinn.  daresay youre right.  its about the time most people stop.

ginger.  youve never thought much about the question yourself, ave you,
mrs. chinn?

mrs. chinn.  i aint fretted much about it.

ginger.  was a time when i didnt.  i used to be all foryou knowlarking
about.  i never thought much about anything.

mrs. chinn.  ah! its a useful habit.

ginger.  what is?

mrs. chinn.  thinking.

ginger.  its what we women avent done enough ofin the past, i mean.
all thats going to be altered.  in the future theres going to be no
difference between men and women.

mrs. chinn.  (_slowly_, _quietly she turns upon_ ginger _her
expressionless eyes_.)

ginger.  mentally, i mean, o course.

mrs. chinn.  (_takes back her eyes_.)

ginger.  do you know, mrs. chinn, that once upon a time there was only
one sex?  (_she spreads herself_.)  hus!

mrs. chinn.  you aint thinking of going back to it, are you?

ginger.  not if the men beave themselves.

mrs. chinn.  perhaps theyre doing their best, poor things!  it dont do
to be too impatient with them.

ginger.  was talking to old dot-and-carry-one the other dy.  you know
who i meanchap with the wooden leg as as is pitch outside the
george.  wot do you wimmen want worrying yourselves about things
outside the ome? e says to me.  youve got the children, e says.
oh, i says, and whose faults that, id like to know?  you wait till
weve got the vote, i says, well soon show you

  (sigsby _enters_.  sigsby _is a dapper little man_, _very brisk and
  bustlinghirsutelooks as if he wanted dusting_, _cleaning up
  generally_.)

sigsby.  that young blackguard come back yet?

ginger.  (_at sound of_ sigsbys _voice she springs up_.  _at first is
about to offer excuses for being found seated_, _but recollects
herself_.)

mrs. chinn.  which one, sir?

sigsby.  young jawboneswhats he call himself?gordon.

mrs. chinn.  not yet, sir.

sigsby.  (_grunts_.)  my chop ready?

mrs. chinn.  i expect its about done.  ill see.

                                                         (_she goes out_.)

sigsby.  (_he turns to_ ginger.)  what can _i_ do for you?

ginger.  (_she produces a letter_.)  i was to wait for an answer.

sigsby.  (_he opens and reads it_.)  what do they expect me to do?

ginger.  er ladyship thought as perhaps you would consult mr. chilvers
imself on the subject.

sigsby.  look here.  what i want to know is this: am i being asked to
regard lady mogton as my opponents election agent, or as my principals
mother-in-law?  that points got to be settled.  (_his vehemence
deepens_.)  look at all these posters.  not to be used, for fear the
other side maynt like them.  now lady mogton writes me that my
candidates supporters are not to employ a certain argument she
disapproves of: because, if they do, shell tell his wife.  is this an
election, or is it a family jar?

  (jawbones _enters_.  jawbones_otherwise_ william gordon_is a
  clean-shaven young hooligan_.  _he wears a bicycle cap on the back of
  his head_, _allowing a picturesque tuft of hair to fall over his
  forehead_.  _evidently he is suffering from controlled indignation_.)

sigsby.  (_seeing him_.)  oh, so youve come back, have you?

jawbones.  i ave, wots left of me.

sigsby.  what have you been doing?

jawbones.  clinging to a roof for the last three hours.

sigsby.  clinging to a roof!  what for?

jawbones.  (_he boils over_.)  wot for?  cos i didnt want to fall off!
wot do you think: cos i was fond of it?

sigsby.  i dont understand

jawbones.  you find yourself alf way up a ladder, posting bills as the
other side as took objection towith a crowd of girls from pinks jam
factory waiting for you at the bottom with a barrel of treacle, and you
_will_ understand.  nothing else for me to do, o course, but to go up.
then they took the ladder away.

sigsby.  where are the bills?

jawbones.  last i see of them was their being put into a earse on its
way to ilford cemetery.

sigsby.  this has got to be seen into.  this sort of thing cant be
allowed to go on.  (_he snatches up his hat_.)

jawbones.  theres another suggestion id like to make.

sigsby.  (_pauses_.)

jawbones.  that is, if this election is going to be fought fairly, that
our side should be provided with at-pins.

sigsby.  (_grunts_.)  tell mrs. chinn to keep that chop warm.

                                                          (_he goes out_.)

ginger.  (_she begins to giggle_.  _it grows into a shrill hee-haw_.)

jawbones.  (_he looks at her fixedly_.)

ginger.  (_her laugh_, _under the stern eye of_ jawbones, _dies away_.)

jawbones.  aint no crowd of you ere, you know.  nothing but my inborn
chivalry to prevent my pulling your nose.

ginger.  (_cowed_, _but simmering_.)  chivalry!  (_a shrill snort_.)

jawbones.  yus.  and dont you put a strain upon it neither.  because i
tell you straight, its weakening.

ginger.  (_his sudden fierceness has completely cowed her_.)

jawbones.  you wimmin

  (_there re-enters_ mrs. chinn _with a tray_.  _he is between them_.)

thats old sigsbys chop?

mrs. chinn.  yes.  he hasnt gone out again, has he?

jawbones.  ill ave it.  get im another.  guess e wont be back for
alf an hour.

mrs. chinn.  hes nasty when his food aint ready.

jawbones.  (_he takes the tray from her_.)  not your fault.  tell im i
took it from you by brute force.

mrs. chinn.  (_she acquiesces with her usual even absence of all
emotion_.)

jawbones.  you neednt stop.  miss rose merton will do the waiting.

ginger.  (_starts_, _then begins to collect her etceteras_.)

mrs. chinn.  perhaps therell be time to cook him another.

                                                         (_she goes out_.)

jawbones.  take off that cover.

ginger.  (_she starts on a bolt for the door_.)

jawbones.  (_he is quite prepared_.  _in an instant he is in front of
her_.)  no, yer dont.

                               (_a pause_.)

take off that cover.

ginger.  (_she still hesitates_.)

jawbones.  if yer dont do what i tell yer, ill ide yer.  im in the
mood.

ginger.  (_she takes off the cover_.)

jawbones.  (_he seats himself and falls to_.)  now pour me out a cup of
tea.

ginger.  (_is pouring it out_.)

jawbones.  know why yer doing it?

ginger.  (_with shrill indignation_.)  yus.  becos yer got me ere alone,
yer beast, with only that cracked image of a mrs. chinn

jawbones.  thatll do.

ginger.  (_it is sufficient_.  _she stops_.)

jawbones.  none of your insults agen a lady as i olds in igh respect.
the rest of it is all right.  becos ive got yer ere alone.  you wimmin,
you think its going to pay you to chuck law and order.  youre out for a
fight, are yer?

ginger.  yus, and were going to win.  brute force as ad its dy.  its
brains wot are going to rule the world.  and weve got em.

                                      (_she has become quite oratorical_.)

jawbones.  glad to ear it.  take my tip: youll use em.  meanwhile ill
ave another cup o tea.

ginger.  (_she takes the cupis making for the window_.)

jawbones.  (_fierce again_.)  i said tea.

ginger.  all right, i was only going to throw the slops out of window.
there aint no basin.

jawbones.  ill tell yer when i want yer to open the window and call for
the plice.  you can throw them into the waste-paper basket.

ginger.  (_she obeys_.)

jawbones.  thank you.  very much obliged.  one of these dys, maybe,
youll marry.

ginger.  when i do, it will be a man, not a monkey.

jawbones.  im not proposing.  im talking to you for your good.

ginger.  (_snorts_.)

jawbones.  youve been listening to a lot of toffs.  easy enough for them
to talk about wimmen not being domestic drudges.  they keep a cook to do
it.  they dont pity e for being a down-trodden slive, spending sixteen
hours a dy in _their_ kitchen with an evening out once a week.  when you
marry it will be to a bloke like me, a working man . . .

ginger.  working!  (_she follows it with a shrill laugh_.)

jawbones.  yus.  theres always a class as laughs when you mention the
word work.  them as knows wot it is, dont.  ive been at it since six
oclock this morning, carrying a ladder, a can of paste weighing twenty
pounds, and two undred double royal posters.  you try it!  when e comes
ome, ell want is victuals.  if youve got em ready for im and are
looking niceno reason why you shouldntand feeling amiable, youll get
on very well together.  if you are going to argue with im about womans
sphere, youll get the worst of it.

ginger.  you always was a bully.

jawbones.  not always.  remember last bank oliday?  (_he winks_.)

ginger.  (_she tries not to give in_.)

jawbones.  ave a cup of tea.  (_he pours it out for her_.)

ginger.  (_the natural woman steals inshe sits_.)

jawbones.  ow are they doing you, fairly well?

ginger.  oh!  well, nothing to grumble at.

jawbones.  you can do a bit o dressing on it.

ginger.  (_she meets his admiring eye_.  _the suffragette departs_.)
dressing dont cost muchwhen youve got tyste.

jawbones.  wot!  not that at?

ginger.  made it myself.

jawbones.  no!

ginger.  honour bright!  tell yer

  (geoffrey _and_ st. herbert _enter_.  jawbones _and_ ginger _make to
  rise_.  ginger _succeeds_.)

geoffrey.  all right, all right.  dont let me disturb the party.
wheres mr. sigsby?

jawbones.  gone to look up the police, i think, sir.  (_having finished_,
_he rises_.)  some of those factory girls been up to their larks again.

geoffrey.  umph!  whats it about this time?

jawbones.  theyve took objection to one of our posters.

geoffrey.  what, another!  (_to_ st. herbert.)  woman has disappointed me
as a fighter.  shes willing enough to strike.  if you hit back, shes
surprised and grieved.

st. herbert.  shes come to the game rather late.

geoffrey.  she might have learned the rules.  (_to_ jawbones.)  which
particular one is it that has failed to meet with their approval?

jawbones.  its rather a good one, sir, from our point of view: why she
left her appy ome.

geoffrey.  i dont seem to remember it.  have i seen it?

jawbones.  i dont think you ave, sir.  it was mr. sigsbys idea.  on
the left, the ruined ome, baby crying its little eart outeldest child
lying on the floor, scaldedupset the tea-kettle over itselfyoungest boy
in flamesbeen playing with the matches, nobody there to stop im.  at
the open door the father, returning from work.  nothing ready for im.
on the other side_er_, on a tub, spouting politics.

geoffrey.  (_to_ st. herbert.)  sounds rather good.

jawbones.  wait a minute.  there was a copy somewhere abouta proof.
(_he is searching for it on the deskfinds it_.)  yus, ere tis.  (_to_
ginger.)  catch old.

               (jawbones _and_ ginger _hold it displayed_.)

thats the one, sir.

st. herbert.  why is the working man, for pictorial purposes, always a
carpenter?

ginger.  its the skirt we object to.

geoffrey.  the skirt!  whats wrong with the skirt?

ginger.  well, its only been out of fashion for the last three years,
thats all.

geoffrey.  oh!  i see.  (_to_ st. herbert.)  weve been hitting them
below the belt.  what do you think i ought to do about it?

st. herbert.  what would you have thought yourself, three weeks ago?

geoffrey.  you and i have been friends ever since we were boys.  you
rather like me, dont you?

st. herbert.  (_puzzled_.)  yes.

geoffrey.  if i were to suddenly hit you on the nose, what would happen?

st. herbert.  i understand.  woman has suddenly started hitting man on
the nose.  her excuse being that she really couldnt keep her hands off
him any longer.

jawbones.  (_he has pinned the poster to the wall_.)  they begun it.  to
ear them talk, youd think as man had never done anything right.

geoffrey.  hes quite right.  their posters are on every hoarding: whos
made all the muddles?  man!  mens promises!  why, its all froth!
woman this time!  i suppose it will have to go.

jawbones.  (_hopefully_.)  up, sir?

geoffrey.  no, jawbones.  into the dust-heap with the rest.

  (jawbones _is disgusted_.  ginger _is triumphant_.)

geoffrey.  i must talk to sigsby.  hes taking the whole thing too
seriously.  it will be some time before we reach that stage.  (_to_
jawbones.)  ask mrs. chinn to bring me a cup of tea.

                          (jawbones _goes out_.)

(_he seats himself at table and takes up some correspondence_.  _to_
ginger.)  are you waiting for any one?

ginger.  a letter from her ladyship.  (_she picks up from the desk and
hands him the letter_ sigsby _had thrown there_.)  her ladyship thought
you ought to be consulted.

geoffrey.  (_he reads the short letter with a gathering frownhands it
across to_ st. herbert.)

st. herbert.  (_having read_, _he passes it back in silence_.)

geoffrey.  (_to_ ginger.)  do you know the contents of this letter?

ginger.  the matter has been discussed among usinformally.

geoffrey.  tell lady mogton illtalk to her myself on the subject.

ginger.  thank you.  (_she collects her etceteras_.)  good afternoon.

geoffrey.  (_shortly_.)  good afternoon.

ginger.  (_she bows graciously to_ st. herbert, _who responds_.  _goes
out_.)

geoffrey.  the devil of it is that its the truth.

st. herbert.  somebody was bound to say it, sooner or later!

geoffrey.  yes, but ones own wife!  this is a confoundedly awkward
situation.

st. herbert.  (_he comes to him_, _stands looking down at him_.)  did it
never occur to you, when you were advocating equal political rights for
women, that awkward situations might arise?

geoffrey.  (_he leans back in his chair_.)  do you remember tommy the
terrier, as they used to call him in the housewas always preaching
socialism?

st. herbert.  quite the most amusing man i ever met!

geoffrey.  and not afraid of being honest.  do you remember his answer
when somebody asked him what he would do if socialism, by any chance,
really became established in england?  he had just married an american
heiress.  he said he should emigrate.  i am still convinced that woman is
entitled to equal political rights with man.  i didnt think it was
coming in my time.  there are points in the problem remaining to be
settled before we can arrive at a working solution.  this is one of them.
(_he takes up the letter and reads_.)  are you prepared to have as your
representative a person who for six months out of every year may be
incapacitated from serving you?  its easy enough to say i oughtnt to
allow my supporters to drag in the personal element.  i like it even less
myself.  but whats the answer?

                     (jawbones _enters with a tray_.)

jawbones.  (_places tray on table_.)  teas coming in a minute, sir.
(_he is clearing away_.)

geoffrey.  never mind all that.  (_he hands him a slip_.)  take this to
the printers.  tell them i must have a proof to-night.

jawbones.  yes, sir.

                                           (_finds his cap and goes out_.)

st. herbert.  the answer, i should say, would be that the majority of
women will continue to find something better to do.  the women who will
throw themselves into politics will be the unattached women, the
childless women.  (_in an instant he sees his mistake_, _but it is too
late_.)

geoffrey.  (_he rises_, _crosses to the desk_, _throws into a
waste-paper-basket a piece of crumpled paper that was in his hand_; _then
turns_.  _the personal note has entered into the discussion_.)  the women
who _want_ to be childlesswhat about them?

st. herbert.  (_he shrugs his shoulders_.)  are there any such?

geoffrey.  there are women who talk openly of womans share in the
general scheme being a burden on heran incubus.

st. herbert.  a handful of cranks.  to the normal woman motherhood has
always been the one supreme desire.

geoffrey.  because children crowned her with honour.  the barren woman
was despised.  all that is changing.  this movement is adding impulse to
it.

st. herbert.  movements do not alter instincts.

geoffrey.  but they do.  ever since man emerged from the jungle he has
been shedding his instinctsshaping them to new desires.  where do you
find this all-prevailing instinct towards maternity?  among the women of
society, who sacrifice it without a moments hesitation to their
vanityto their mere pleasures?  the middle-class womanshe, too, is
demanding freedom.  children, servants, the home!they are too much for
her nerves.  and now there comes this new development, appealing to the
intellectual woman.  is there not danger of her preferring political
ambition, the excitement of public life, to what has come to be regarded
as the drudgery of turning four walls into a home, of peopling the
silence with the voices of the children?  (_he crosses to the tablelays
his hand again upon the open letter_.)  how do you know that this may not
be her answeri have no children.  i never mean to have children?

  (sigsby _enters in company with_ ben lamb, m.p.  lamb _is a short_,
  _thick-set_, _good-tempered man_.)

ah, lamb, how are you?

lamb.  (_they greet one another_.)  how are things going?

sigsby.  theyre not going at all well.

geoffrey.  sigsby was ever the child of despondency.

sigsby.  yes, and so will you be when you find yourself at the bottom of
the poll.

geoffrey.  (_the notion takes him by surprise_.)

lamb.  its going to be a closer affair than any of us thought.  its the
joke of the thing that appears to have got hold of them.  they want to
see what will happen.

geoffrey.  mans fatal curiosity concerning the eternal feminine!

sigsby.  yes, and they wont have to pay for it.  that will be our
department.

st. herbert.  (_to_ sigsby.)  what do you think theyll do, supposing by
any chance mrs. chilvers should head the poll?

sigsby.  how do you meanwhatll they do?

st. herbert.  do you think theyll claim the seat?

sigsby.  claim the seat!  what do you think theyre out fortheir health?
get another six months advertisement, if they dont get anything else.
meanwhile whats our positionjust at the beginning of our ministerial
career?

geoffrey.  they will not claim the seat.

sigsby.  how do you know?

geoffrey.  i know my wife.

lamb.  (_after a moments silence_.)  quite sure you do?

geoffrey.  (_turns_.)

lamb.  ever seen a sheep fighting mad?  i have.  damned sight worse than
the old ram.

geoffrey.  she doesnt fight the ram.

lamb.  (_he makes a sweeping movement that takes in the room_, _the
electionall things_.)  whats all this?  we thought woman hadnt got the
fighting instinctthat we knew her.  my boy, were in the infants
class.

sigsby.  if you want to be his majestys under-secretary for home
affairs, you take my tip, guvnor, youll win this election.

geoffrey.  what more can i do than im doing?  how can i countenance this
sort of thing?  (_he indicates the posters_.)  declare myself dead
against the whole movement?

lamb.  youll do it later.  may as well do it soon.

geoffrey.  why must i do it?

lamb.  because youre beginning to find out what it means.

      (_a pause_.  _the door is open_.  annys _is standing there_.)

annys.  dare we venture into the enemys camp?

  (_she enters_, _laughing_, _followed by_ elizabeth _and_ phoebe.  annys
  is somewhat changed _from the grave_, _dreamy_ annys _of a short week
  ago_.  _she is brimming over with vitalityexcitement_.  _there is a
  decisiveness_, _an egoism_, _about her that seems new to her_.  _the
  womens skirts make a flutter_.  _a breeze seems to have entered_.
  annys _runs to her husband_.  _for the moment the election fades away_.
  _they are all smiles_, _tenderness for one another_.)

annys.  dont tell, will you?  mamma would be so shocked.  do you know
you havent been near me for three days?

geoffrey.  umph!  i like that.  where were you last night?

annys.  last night?  in the neighbourhood of leicester square till three
oclock.  oh, geoff, theres such a lot wants altering!

                                        (_she turns to greet the others_.)

geoffrey.  your ruining your health wont do it.  youre looking fagged
to death.

annys.  (_she shakes hands with_ sigsby.)  how are you?  (_to_ lamb.)
im so glad youre helping him.  (_she turns again to_ geoffrey.)  pure
imagination, dearest.  i never felt better in my life.

geoffrey.  umph!  look at all those lines underneath your eyes.  (_he
shakes hands with_ elizabeth.)  how do you do?  (_to_ phoebe.)  how are
you?

annys.  (_she comes back to himmakes to smooth the lines from his
forehead_.)  look at all those, there.  well run away together for a
holiday, when its all over.  what are you doing this evening?

sigsby.  you promised to speak at a smoker to-night; the bow and bromley
buffaloes.

annys.  oh, bother the buffaloes.  take me out to dinner.  i am free
after seven.

  (mrs. chinn _has enteredis arranging the table for tea_.  annys _goes
  to her_.)

how are you, mrs. chinn?

mrs. chinn.  (_she wipes her hand on her apron before taking_ annyss
_proffered hand_.)

geoffrey.  (_to_ sigsby.)  i can turn up there later in the evening.
(_he joins the others for a momenttalks with them_.)

mrs. chinn.  (_now shaking hands_.)  quite well, thank you, maam.  (_she
has cast a keen_, _motherly glance at_ annys.)  i hope youre taking care
of yourself, maam.

annys.  of course i am.  we politicians owe it to our party.  (_laughs_.)
how are they getting on here, without me?

mrs. chinn.  well, maam, from what i can see, i think mr. chilvers is
trusting a little too much to his merits.  shall i bring some more cups
and saucers, sir?

geoffrey.  ah! yes!  (_to_ annys.)  youll have some tea?

annys.  strong, please, mrs. chinn.

                         (mrs. chinn _goes out_.)

(_laughs_.)  yes, i know its bad for me.  (_she puts a hand over his
mouth_.)

phoebe.  old mother chinn is quite right, you know, geoff.  youre not
putting up a good fight.

geoffrey.  (_a slight irritability begins to show itself_.)  i frankly
confess that i am not used to fighting women.

elizabeth.  yes.  it was easier, no doubt, when we took it lying down.

annys.  you promised, if i brought you, that you would be good.

geoffrey.  i wish it had been you.

phoebe.  yes, but we dont!

                  (_as she and_ elizabeth _move away_.)

did you have a row with the doctor when you were born?

  (_to which_ elizabeth _replies_, _though the words reach only_ phoebe:
  _i might have_, _if i had known that my mother was doing all the
  work_, _while he was pocketing the fee_!)

lamb.  you see, mrs. chilvers, our difficulty is that there is nothing to
be said against youexcept one thing.

annys.  whats that?

lamb.  that youre a woman.

annys.  (_smiling_.)  isnt that enough?

sigsby.  quite enough, mrs. chilvers, if the guvnor would only say it.

annys.  (_to_ geoffrey.)  why dont you?  ill promise not to deny it.

  (_the others drift apart_.  _they group themselves near to the window_.
  _they talk togethergrow evidently interested and excited_.)

geoffrey.  i have just had a letter from yourelection agent, expressing
indignation with one of my supporters for merely having hinted at the
fact.

annys.  i dont understand.

geoffrey.  (_he takes from the table the letter and hands it to her in
silence_.  _he seats himself on the settee and watches her_.)

annys.  (_she seats herself on a chair just opposite to him_; _reads the
letter through in silence_.)  in my case it does not apply.

geoffrey.  how do you know?

annys.  (_the atmosphere has grown suddenly oppressive_.)  oh, ii think
we might find some other reason than that.  (_she hands him back the
letter_.)

geoffrey.  its the only one of any importance.  it embraces all the
others.  shall woman be motheror politician?  (_he puts the letter in
his pocket_.)

annys.  why cannot she be both?

geoffrey.  (_he is looking at her searchingly_.)  because if she is the
one, she doesnt want to be the other.

                              (_a silence_.)

annys.  you are wrong.  it is the mother instinct that makes us
politicians.  we want to take care of the world.

geoffrey.  exactly.  you think mans job more interesting than your own.

annys.  (_after a moment_.)  who told you that it was a mans job?

geoffrey.  well.  (_he shrugs his shoulders_.)  we cant do yours.

annys.  cant we help each other?

geoffrey.  as, for instance, in this election!  (_he gives a short
laugh_.)

annys.  of course, this is an exceptional case.

geoffrey.  its an epitome of the whole question.  you are trying to take
my job away from me.  to the neglect of your own.

annys.  (_after another moments silence_.)  havent i always tried to do
my duty?

geoffrey.  i have thought so.

annys.  oh, my dear, we mustnt quarrel.  you will win this election.  i
want you to win it.  next time we must fight side by side again.

geoffrey.  dont you see?  fighting you means fighting the whole
movement.  (_he indicates the posters pinned to the walls_.)  that sort
of thing.

annys.  (_after a brief inspection_.)  not that way.  (_shaking her
head_.)  it would break my heart for you to turn against us.  win because
you are the better man.  (_smiling_.)  i want you to be the better man.

geoffrey.  i would rather be your husband.

annys.  (_smiling_.)  isnt that the same thing?

geoffrey.  no.  i want a wife.

annys.  what precisely do you mean by wife?

geoffrey.  its an old-established word.

  (mrs. chinn _has entered to complete the tea arrangements_.  _she is
  arranging the table_.)

mrs. chinn.  theres a deputation downstairs, sir, just come for you.

geoffrey.  what are they?

mrs. chinn.  its one of those societies for the reform of something.
they said you were expecting them.

sigsby.  (_breaking away from the group by the window_.)  quite right.
(_looks at his watch_.)  five oclock, ill bring them up.

geoffrey.  happen to know what it is they want to reform?

sigsby.  (_by door_.)  laws relating to the physical relationship between
the sexes, i think.

geoffrey.  oh, only that!

sigsby.  something of the sort.

(_he goes out_.  mrs. chinn _also by the other door_.)

geoffrey.  (_rising_.)  will you pour out?

annys.  (_she has been thinking_.  _she comes back to the present_.)  we
shant be in your way?

geoffrey.  oh, no.  it will make it easier to get rid of them.

  (annys _changes her chair_.  _the others gather round_.  _the service
  and drinking of tea proceeds in the usual course_.)

(_to_ elizabeth.)  youll take some tea?

elizabeth.  thank you.

geoffrey.  you must be enjoying yourself just now.

elizabeth.  (_makes a moue_.)  they insist on my being agreeable.

annys.  its so good for her.  teaches her self-control.

lamb.  i gather from mrs. spender, that in the perfect world there will
be no men at all.

elizabeth.  oh, yes, they will be there.  but in their proper place.

st. herbert.  thats why you didnt notice them.

  (_the_ deputation _reaches the door_.  _the sound of voices is heard_.)

phoebe.  shes getting on very well.  if she isnt careful, shell end up
by being a flirt.

  (_the_ deputation _enters_, _guided by_ sigsby.  _its number is five_,
  _two men and three women_.  _eventually they group themselvessome
  standing_, _some sittingeach side of_ geoffrey.  _the others gather
  round_ annys, _who keeps her seat at the opposite side of the table_.)

sigsby.  (_talking as he enters_.)  exactly what ive always maintained.

hopper.  it would make the husband quite an interesting person.

sigsby.  (_cheerfully_.)  thats the idea.  here we are, guvnor.  this
is mr. chilvers.

  (geoffrey _bows_, _the_ deputation _also_.  sigsby _introduces a
  remarkably boyish-looking man_, _dressed in knickerbockers_.)

sigsby.  this is mr. peekin, who has kindly consented to act as
spokesman.  (_to the_ deputation, _generally_.)  will you have some tea?

miss borlasse.  (_a thick-set_, _masculine-featured lady_, _with short
hair and heavy eyebrows_.  _her deep_, _decisive tone settles the
question_.)  thank you.  we have so little time.

mr. peekin.  we propose, mr. chilvers, to come to the point at once.
(_he is all smiles_, _caressing gestures_.)

geoffrey.  excellent.

peekin.  if i left a baby at your door, what would you do with it?

geoffrey.  (_for a moment he is taken aback_, _recovers himself_.)  are
you thinking of doing so?

peekin.  its not impossible.

geoffrey.  well, it sounds perhaps inhospitable, but do you know i really
think i should ask you to take it away again.

peekin.  yes, but by the time you find it there, i shall have
disappearedskedaddled.

hopper.  good.  (_he rubs his hands_.  _smiles at the others_.)

geoffrey.  in that case i warn you that i shall hand it over to the
police.

peekin.  (_he turns to the others_.)  i dont myself see what else mr.
chilvers could be expected to do.

miss borlasse.  hed be a fool not to.

geoffrey.  thank you.  so far we seem to be in agreement.  and now may i
ask to what all this is leading?

peekin.  (_he changes from the debonnair to the dramatic_.)  how many
men, mr. chilvers, leave their babies every year at the door of
poverty-stricken women?  what are they expected to do with them?

  (_a moment_.  _the_ deputation _murmur approval_.)

geoffrey.  i see.  but is there no difference between the two doors?  i
am not an accomplice.

peekin.  an accomplice!  is the ignorant servant-girlfirst lured into
the public-house, cajoled, tricked, deceived by false promisesthe
half-starved shop-girl in the hands of the practised libertineis she an
accomplice?

mrs. peekin.  (_a dowdily-dressed_, _untidy woman_, _but the face is
sweet and tender_.)  ah, mr. chilvers, if you could only hear the stories
that i have heard from dying lips.

geoffrey.  very pitiful, my dear lady.  and, alas, only too old.  but
there are others.  it would not be fair to blame always the man.

annys.  (_unnoticed_, _drawn by the subject_, _she has risen and come
down_.)  perhaps not.  but the punishment always falls on the woman.  is
_that_ quite fair?

geoffrey.  (_he is irritated at_ annyss _incursion into the
discussion_.)  my dear annys, that is natures law, not mans.  all man
can do is to mitigate it.

peekin.  that is all we ask.  the suffering, the shame, must always be
the womans.  surely that is sufficient.

geoffrey.  what do you propose?

miss borlasse.  (_in her deep_, _fierce tones_.)  that all children born
out of wedlock should be a charge upon the rates.

miss ricketts.  (_a slight_, _fair_, _middle-aged woman_, _with a nervous
hesitating manner_.)  of course, only if the mother wishes it.

geoffrey.  (_the proposal staggers him_.  _but the next moment it
inspires him with mingled anger and amusement_.)  my dear, good people,
have you stopped for one moment to consider what the result of your
proposal would be?

peekin.  for one thing, mr. chilvers, the adding to the populace of
healthy children in place of the stunted and diseased abortions that is
all that these poor women, out of their scanty earnings, can afford to
present to the state.

geoffrey.  humph!  that incidentally it would undermine the whole
institution of marriage, let loose the flood-gates that at present hold
immorality in check, doesnt appear to trouble you.  that the law must be
altered to press less heavily upon the womanthat the man must be made an
equal sharer in the penaltyall that goes without saying.  the remedy you
propose would be a thousand times worse than the disease.

annys.  and meanwhile?  until you have devised this scheme (_there is a
note of contempt in her voice_) under which escape for the man will be
impossible?

geoffrey.  the evil must continue.  as other evils have to until the true
remedy is found.

peekin.  (_he has hurriedly consulted with the others_.  _all have
risenhe turns to_ geoffrey.)  you will not support our demand?

geoffrey.  support it!  do you mean that you cannot yourselves see that
you are holding out an indemnity to every profligate, male and female,
throughout the landthat you would be handicapping, in the struggle for
existence, every honest man and woman desirous of bringing up their
children in honour and in love?  your suggestion is monstrous!

peekin.  (_the little man is not without his dignity_.)  we apologise,
mr. chilvers, for having taken up your time.

geoffrey.  i am sorry the matter was one offering so little chance of
agreement.

peekin.  we will make only one slight further trespass on your kindness.
mrs. chilvers, if one may judge, would seem to be more in sympathy with
our views.  might weit would be a saving of time and shoe leather (_he
smiles_)might we take this opportunity of laying our case before her?

geoffrey.  it would be useless.

  (_a short silence_.  annys, _with_ elizabeth _and_ phoebe _a little
  behind her_, _stands right_.  lamb, sigsby, _and_ st. herbert _are
  behind_ geoffrey _centre_.  _the_ deputation _is left_.)

hopper.  do we gather that in this election you speak for both
candidates?

geoffrey.  in matters of common decency, yes.  my wife does not associate
herself with movements for the encouragement of vice.

                  (_there is another moments silence_.)

annys.  but, geoffrey, dearwe should not be encouraging the evil.  we
should still seek to find the man, to punish him.  the woman would still
suffer

geoffrey.  my dear annys, this is neither the time nor place for you and
me to argue out the matter.  i must ask you to trust to my judgment.

annys.  i can understand your refusing, but why do you object to my

geoffrey.  because i do not choose for my wifes name to be linked with a
movement that i regard as criminal.  i forbid it.

  (_it was the moment that was bound to come_.  _the mans instincts_,
  _training_, _have involuntarily asserted themselves_.  _shall the woman
  yield_?  _if so_, _then down goes the whole movementher claim to
  freedom of judgment_, _of action_, _in all things_.  _all watch the
  struggle with breathless interest_.)

annys.  (_she speaks very slowly_, _very quietly_, _but with a new note
in her voice_.)  i am sorry, but i have given much thought to this
matter, andi do not agree with you.

mrs. peekin.  you will help us?

annys.  i will do what i can.

peekin.  (_he takes from his pocket a folded paper_.)  it is always so
much more satisfactory when these things are in writing.  candidates,
with the best intentions in the world, are apt to forget.  (_he has
spread the paper on a corner of the table_.  _he has in his hand his
fountain-pen_.)

annys.  (_with a smile_.)  i am not likely to forget, but if you wish
it(_she approaches the table_.)

geoffrey.  (_he interposes_.  _his voice is very low_, _almost a
whisper_.)  my wife will not sign.

annys.  (_she also speaks low_, _but there is no yielding in her voice_.)
i am not only your wife.  i have a duty also to others.

geoffrey.  it is for you to choose.  (_he leaves the way open to her_.)

  (_the silence can almost be felt_.  _she moves to the table_, _takes up
  the paper_.  _it contains but a few lines of writing_.  _having read
  it_, _she holds out her hand for the pen_.  peekin _puts it in her
  hand_.  _with a firm hand she signs_, _folds the paper_, _and returns
  it to him_.  _she remains standing by the table_.  _with the removal of
  the tension there comes a rustle_, _a breaking of the silence_.)

miss ricketts.  (_she seizes_ annyss _hand_, _hanging listlessly by her
side_, _and_, _stooping_, _kisses it_.)

miss borlasse.  that is all, isnt it?

peekin.  we thank you, mrs. chilvers.  good afternoon.

annys.  (_the natural reaction is asserting itself_.  _she pulls herself
together sufficiently to murmur her answer_.)  good afternoon.

mrs. peekin.  (_the_ deputation _is moving away_; _she takes from her
waist a small bunch of flowers_, _and_, _turning_, _places them in_
annyss _hand_.)

annys.  (_she smiles_, _remains standing silent_, _the flowers in her
hand_.)

  (_good afternoons_ _are exchanged with some of the others_.
  _finally_:)

peekin.  good afternoon, mr. chilvers.

geoffrey.  (_who has moved away_.)  good afternoon.

  (_the_ deputation _joins_ sigsby _by the door_.  _he leads them out_.)

elizabeth.  (_to_ phoebe.)  are you going my way?

phoebe.  (_she glances round at_ annys.)  yes, ill come with you.

st. herbert.  i will put you into a bus, if you will let me.  we dont
sport many cabs in east poplar.  (_he is helping_ elizabeth _with her
cloak_.)

elizabeth.  thank you.

lamb.  ive got to go up west.  (_to_ geoffrey.)  will you be at the
house this evening?

geoffrey.  (_he is standing by the desk pretending to look at some
papers_.)  i shall look in about ten oclock.

lamb.  one or two things i want to say to you.  goodbye for the present.

geoffrey.  goodbye!

phoebe.  goodbye, old man.  (_she stretches out her hand_.)

geoffrey.  goodbye.  (_she shakes hands with a smile_, _exchanges a
casual_ _goodbye_ _with_ elizabeth.)

                      (_they go towards the door_.)

                          (sigsby _re-enters_.)

sigsby.  (_to_ lamb.)  are you going?

lamb.  yes.  ill see you to-morrow morning.  about ten oclock.

sigsby.  i shall be here.  (_he exchanges a_ _good afternoon_ _with the
others_.)

  (_they go out_.  sigsby _crosses and goes into the other room_.)

annys.  (_she has let fall the flowers on the table_.  _she crosses to
where_ geoffrey _still stands by the desk_, _his back towards her_.  _she
stretches out her hand_, _touches him_.  _he does not move_.)  geoffrey!

                    (_but still he takes no notice_.)

i am so sorry.  we must talk it over quietlyat home.

geoffrey.  (_he turns_.)  home!  i have no home.  i have neither children
nor wife.  i _keep_ a political opponent.

  (annys _starts back with a cry_.  _he crosses in front of her and seats
  himself at the table_.  _the flowers are lying there_; _he throws them
  into the waste-paper basket_.)

annys.  (_she puts on her cloak_, _moves towards the door_.  _half-way
she pauses_, _makes a movement towards him_.  _but he will not see_.
_then a hard look comes into her eyes_, _and without another word she
goes out_, _leaving the door open_.)

              (sigsby _is heard moving in the other room_.)

geoffrey.  (_he is writing_.)  sigsby.

sigsby.  hallo!

geoffrey.  that poster i told young gordon i wouldnt sanction, the
woman spouting politics, the man returning to a slatterns home.

                            (sigsby _enters_.)

sigsby.  i have countermanded them.

geoffrey.  countermand them again.  we shall want a thousand.

sigsby.  (_can hardly believe his ears_.)

geoffrey.  (_with a gesture round the room_.)  all of them.  a man for
men!  save the children!  guard your homes!  all the damned
collection.  order as many as you want.

sigsby.  (_his excitement rising_.)  i can go ahead.  you mean it?

geoffrey.  (_he looks at him_.)  its got to be a fight!  (_a moment_.
_he returns to his writing_.)  telephone hake that i shall be dining at
the reform club.

jawbones.  shut the door, cant yer!

ginger.  dont yer want a draught?

jawbones.  no, i dont.  not any more than ive got.

ginger.  (_she shuts the door_.)  ave they begun counting the votes?

jawbones.  been at it for the last three-quarters of an hour.

ginger.  whos going to win?

jawbones.  one of em.

  (lady mogton _has entered_.  _she has come from the room where they are
  counting the votes_.)

shut that door!  (_he glances over his shoulder_, _sees his mistake_.)
beg pardon!  (_to himself_.)  thought twas the other fool!

lady mogton.  (_she shuts the door_.  _to_ ginger.)  have you seen mrs.
chilvers?

ginger.  not since the afternoon, your ladyship.

lady mogton.  she is coming, i suppose?

ginger.  i think so, your ladyship.

lady mogton.  its very cold in here, gordon.

jawbones.  yes, my lady.  not what i call a cosy room.

lady mogton.  (_to_ ginger.)  jump into a cab.  see if you can find her.
perhaps she has been detained at one of the committee-rooms.  tell her
she ought to be here.

ginger.  yes, your ladyship.  (_she crosses_, _opens door_.)

jawbones.  shut the door.

ginger.  oh, shut

  (_she finds herself face to face with a_ messenger _carrying a
  ballot-box_.)

i beg yer pardon!  (_she goes out_, _closes door_.)

lady mogton.  (_to the_ messenger.)  is that the last?

messenger.  generally is.  isle of dogs!

                                          (_he goes into the other room_.)

lady mogton.  (_to_ jawbones.)  do you know where mr. chilvers is?

  (_there comes a bloodthirsty yell from the crowd outside_.)

jawbones.  not unless thats im.  (_he finishes for the time being with
the fire_.  _rises_.)

                            (janet _enters_.)

lady mogton.  was that you they were yelling at?

janet.  no, its mr. sigsby.

(_another yell is heard_.  _out of it a shrill female voice__mind is
fice_; _yer spoiling it_!)

the womans laundry union have taken such a strong dislike to him.

  (_a final yell_.  _then a voice_: _thats taken some of the starch out
  of him_! _followed by a shriek of laughter_.)

jawbones.  e only suggested as ow there was enough old washerwomen in
parliament as it was.

lady mogton.  a most unnecessary remark.  it will teach him

  (sigsby _enters_, _damaged_.  _his appearance is comic_.  lady mogton
  _makes no effort to repress a grim smile_.)

sigsby.  funny, aint it?

lady mogton.  i am sorry.

sigsby.  (_he snarls_.)  the mothers hand shall help us!  one of your
posters, i think.

lady mogton.  you shouldnt have insulted themcalling them old
washerwomen!

sigsby.  insult!  cant one indulge in a harmless _jeu desprit_(_he
pronounces it according to his own ideas_)without having ones clothes
torn off ones back?  (_fiercely_.)  what do you mean by itdisgracing
your sex?

lady mogton.  are you addressing me?

sigsby.  all of you.  upsetting the foundations upon which society has
been rearedthe natural and lawful subjection of the woman to the man.
why dont you read st. paul?

lady mogton.  st. paul was addressing christians.  when men behave like
christians there will be no need of votes for women.  you read st. paul
on men.  (_to_ janet.)  i shall want you!

                                    (_she goes out_, _followed by_ janet.)

                   (sigsby _gives vent to a gesture_.)

jawbones.  getting saucy, aint they?

sigsby.  over-indulgence.  thats what the modern woman is suffering
from.  gets an idea on monday that shed like the whole world altered; if
it isnt done by saturday, raises hell!  wheres the guvnor?

jawbones.  hasnt been here.

sigsby.  (_hands_ jawbones _his damaged hat_.)  see if they can do
anything to that.  if not, get me a new one.  (_he forks out a
sovereign_.)  sure to be some shops open in the high street.

                    (lamb _and_ st. herbert _enter_.)

lamb.  hallo! have they been mauling you?

sigsby.  (_he snatches the damaged hat from_ jawbones, _to hand it back
the next moment_; _holds it out_.)  womans contribution to politics.
get me a collar at the same timesixteen and a half.

  (jawbones _takes his cap and goes out_.  _the men hang up their
  overcoats_.)

sigsby.  wheres it all going to end?  thats what i want to know!

st. herbert.  where most things end.  in the millennium, according to its
advocates.  in the ruin of the country, according to its opponents.  in
mild surprise on the part of the next generation that ever there was any
fuss about it.

sigsby.  in amazement, you mean, that their fathers were so blind as not
to see where it was leading.  my boy, this is going to alter the whole
relationship between the sexes!

st. herbert.  is it so perfect as it is?

                              (_a silence_.)

might it not be established on a more workable, a more enduring basis if
woman were allowed a share in the shaping of it?

  (_some woman in the crowd starts the refrain_, _well hang old asquith
  on a sour apple tree_.  _it is taken up with quiet earnestness by
  others_.)

sigsby.  shaping it!  nice sort of shape it will be by the time that lot
(_with a gesture_, _including the crowd_, lady mogton & co.) have done
knocking it about.  wouldnt be any next generation to be surprised at
anything if some of them had their way.

st. herbert.  the housebreakers come firstnot a class of work demanding
much intelligence; the builders come later.  have you seen chilvers?

lamb.  i left him at the house.  he couldnt get away.

sigsby.  theres your object-lesson for you.  we dont need to go far.  a
mans whole career ruined by the wife he nourishes.

st. herbert.  how do you mean, ruined?

sigsby.  so it is.  if she wins the election and claims the seat.  do you
think the cabinet will want him?  their latest addition compelled to
appeal to the house of commons to fight for him against his own
womenfolk.  (_grunts_.)  hell be the laughing-stock of the whole
country.

st. herbert.  do you know for certain that they mean to claim the seat?

sigsby.  wait and see is their answer.

lamb.  hasnt chilvers any idea?

sigsby.  cant get him to talk.  dont think hes seen her since that
shindy over the deputation.

lamb.  humph!

sigsby.  even if she herself wished to draw back, the others would
overrule her.

lamb.  im not so sure of that.  shes got a way of shutting her mouth
that reminds me of my old woman.

sigsby.  the arrangement, as he explained it to me, was that the whole
thing was to end with the polling.  it was to have been a mere joke, a
mere _ballon dessai_.  the mistake he made was thinking he could depend
on her.

lamb.  guess she made the same mistake.  you can fight and shake hands
afterwards; it doesnt go with kissing.

sigsby.  man and woman were not made to fight.  it was never intended.

  (_the womans_ _marseillaise_ _has been taken up by the crowd_.  _the
  chorus has been reached_.)

oh, damn your row!  (_he slams to the window_; _it was ajar_.)

             (jawbones _has entered_, _with his purchases_.)

(_turning from window he sees_ jawbones, _goes to meet him_.)  couldnt
they do anything?

jawbones.  (_he has bought a new hat_; _has also brought back the
remains_.  _he shakes his head_.)  no good for anything else but a
memento.

sigsby.  (_with a grunt he snatches the thing and flings it into a
corner_.  _tries on the new one_.)

jawbones.  ows it feel?

  (sigsby, _with the help of_ jawbones, _attends to his appearance_.)

lamb.  (_to_ st. herbert.)  no use talking to her, i suppose?

st. herbert.  (_shrugs his shoulders_.)  shell do what she imagines to
be her duty.  women are so uncivilised.

  (_a burst of cheering is heard_.  _a shrill male voice_: _three cheers
  for winston churchill_!  _it is followed by an explosion of yells_.)

st. herbert.  whos that?

lamb.  (_he has opened the window_.)  phoebe mogton!

sigsby.  what a family!

                          (janet _has entered_.)

janet.  is that mrs. chilvers?  (_to_ lamb _and_ st. herbert.)  good
evening.

st. herbert.  good evening.

lamb.  no; its her sister.

janet.  i wonder she doesnt come.

sigsby.  what are the latest figures?  do you know?

                            (phoebe _enters_.)

janet.  i forget the numbers.  mrs. chilvers is forty ahead.

phoebe.  forty ahead!  (_to_ janet.)  did you order the band?

lamb.  (_to_ sigsby.)  the dock division was against him to a man; that
shipping bill has upset them.

janet.  no.  i didnt think we should want the band.

phoebe.  not want it!  my dear girl

janet.  perhaps lady mogton has ordered it, ill ask her.

                                                         (_she goes out_.)

sigsby.  hadnt you better wait and see?  it isnt over yet.

phoebe.  we may as well have it!  it can play the dead march in saul if
you win.  (_she laughs_.)

sigsby.  (_grunts_.  _to_ lamb.)  are you coming?

                                                          (_he goes out_.)

lamb.  yes.  (_to_ st. herbert.)  are you coming?

st. herbert.  hardly worth while; nearly over, isnt it?

lamb.  it generally takes an hour and a half.  (_he looks at his watch_.)
another forty minutes.  perhaps less.

                                                          (_he goes out_.)

phoebe.  i do love to make him ratty.  wish it wasnt poor old geoff we
were fighting.

st. herbert.  when i marry, it will be the womanly woman.

phoebe.  no chance for me then?

st. herbert.  i dont say that.  i can see you taking your political
opinions from your husband, and thinking them your own.

phoebe.  good heavens!

st. herbert.  the brainy woman will think for herself.  and then i
foresee some lively breakfast tables.

phoebe.  humph!  no fear, i suppose, of a man taking his views from his
wife and thinking them his own?

st. herbert.  that may be the solution.  the brainy woman will have to
marry the manly man.

                            (ginger _enters_.)

jawbones.  (_he is on his knees blowing the fire_.  _in a low growl_.)
shut the door!

ginger.  cant till im inside, can i?  (_shuts it_.)  wheres lady
mogton?

jawbones.  i dont know.

phoebe.  what do you want her for?

ginger.  only to tell her that i cant find chilvers.

phoebe.  isnt she here?

ginger.  not unless shes come while ive been out.

                            (janet _enters_.)

janet.  oh, lady mogton

phoebe.  (_interrupting her_.)  isnt annys here?

janet.  no.  (_to_ ginger.)  havent you found her?

ginger.  (_shakes her head_.)  been everywhere i could think of.

phoebe.  (_to herself_.)  she couldnt have gone home?  is there a
telephone here?

janet.  the rooms locked up.

jawbones.  theres one at 118, high street.  shall i go, miss?

phoebe.  no, thanks.  ill go myself.  oh, what about the band?

janet.  lady mogton says shed like it.  if it isnt too tired.

ginger.  its at sells coffee-ouse in piggott street.  i eard them
practising.

phoebe.  good.  i shant be more than a few minutes.

st. herbert.  ill come with you, if i may?  ive got some news that may
be of use to you.

phoebe.  do.  (_to_ ginger.)  stop here, i may want you.

(phoebe _and_ st. herbert _go out_.)

janet.  how was mrs. chilvers seeming this afternoon?

ginger.  never eard er speak better, miss.

janet.  did you stop to the end?

ginger.  not quite.  mrs. spender wanted some shopping done.

                           (janet _goes out_.)

ginger.  can i elp yer?

jawbones.  yer might hold the piper while i blow.

                       (_the fire begins to burn_.)

ginger.  its getting brighter.

jawbones.  thats caught it.

ginger.  wonderful what a little coaxing will do.

jawbones.  (_he is still squatting on his heels_, _folding up the paper_.
_he looks up_.)  aint yer ever thought of that, instead of worrying
about the vote?

ginger.  (_she moves away_.)  you dont understand us wimmin.

jawbones.  (_he has risen_.  _he pauses in his folding of the paper_.)
dont say that.

ginger.  why should we coax yerfor our rights?

jawbones.  because its the easiest way of getting em.

ginger.  (_she has become oratorical_.)  our appeal is not to man (_with
upraised hand_) but to justice!

jawbones.  oh!  and what does the lidy say?

ginger.  (_descending_.)  ow do yer mean?

jawbones.  to your appeal.  is she goin to give em to yer?  you tike my
tip: if yer in a urry, you get a bit on accountfrom man.  ere.  (_he
dives into his pocket_, _produces_, _wrapped up in tissue paper_, _a
ring_, _which he exhibits to her_.)  thats a bit more in your line.

ginger.  (_her eyes sparkle_.  _she takes the ring in her hand_.  _then
problems come to her_.)  why do yer want me, william?

jawbones.  because, in spite of all, i love yer.

ginger.  (_she looks into the future_.)  what will i be?  a general
servant, without wages.

jawbones.  the question, as it seems to me, is, which of us two is the
biggest fool?  instead of thirty bob a week in my pocket to spend as i
likeguess ill ave to be content with three alf-crowns.

ginger.  seven an six!  rather a lot, bill, out o thirty bob.  dont
leave much for me an the children.

jawbones.  i shall ave to get my dinners.

ginger.  i could mike yer somethin tasty to tike with yer.  then with,
saythree shillings

jawbones.  ere(_he is on the point of snatching back the ring_.  _he
encounters her eyes_.  _there is a moments battle_.  _the eternal
feminine conquers_.)  will yer always look as sweet as yer do now?

ginger.  always, bill.  so long as yer good to me!

  (_she slips the ring over her finger_, _still with her eyes drawing
  him_.  _he catches her to him in fierce passion_, _kisses her_.)

  (_a loud shrill female cheer comes from the crowd_.  _the cheer is
  renewed and renewed_.)

jawbones.  (_he breaks away and goes to the window_.)  ullo!  what are
they shoutin about now?  (_he looks out_.)  its the donah!

ginger.  mrs. chilvers?

jawbones.  yus.  better not get wearin itmay shock their feelings.

ginger.  (_she gazes rapturously at the ring as she draws it off_.)  it
is a beauty!  i do love yer, bill.

  (_there enter_ annys _and_ elizabeth.  annys _is excited_; _she is
  laughing and talking_.)

annys.  (_laughing while she rearranges her hat and hair_.)  a little
embarrassing.  that red-haired girlshe carried me right up the steps.  i
was afraid she would

  (jawbones _has been quick enough to swing a chair into place just in
  time to receive her_.)

(_she recovers herself_.)  thank you.

elizabeth.  (_she hands_ annys _a smelling-bottle_.  _to_ jawbones.)
open the window a few inches.

  (_he does so_.  _some woman_, _much interrupted_, _is making a
  speech_.)

  (janet _opens the door a little way and looks in_.)

janet.  oh, it is you!  i am glad!

                         (_she goes out again_.)

elizabeth.  are the others all here?

ginger.  er ladyship is watching the counting.  miss phoebe as just
gone out

                            (phoebe _enters_.)

oh, ere she is.

phoebe.  hullo!  (_she is taking off her things_.)  wherever have you
been?  weve been scouring the neighbourhood

               (lady mogton _enters_, _followed by_ janet.)

i say, youre looking jolly chippy.

elizabeth.  we had an extra enthusiastic meeting.  she spoke for rather a
long time.  i made her come home with me and lie down.  i think she is
all right now.

lady mogton.  would you like to see a doctor?

phoebe.  there is a very good man close here.  (_she turns to_ jawbones,
_who is still near the window_.)  gordon

annys.  (_interrupting_.)  no.  please dont.  i am quite all right.  i
hate strange doctors.

phoebe.  well, let me send for whitby; he could be here in twenty
minutes.

annys.  i wish you would all leave me alone.  theres absolutely nothing
to fuss about whatever.  we pampered womenwe cant breathe the same air
that ordinary mortals have to.  we ought to be ashamed of ourselves.

phoebe.  (_to herself_.)  obstinate pig.

  (_she catches_ jawbones _eye_; _unnoticed by the others_, _she takes
  him aside_.  _they whisper_.)

annys.  how is it going?

lady mogton.  you must be prepared for winning.  (_she puts again the
question that_ annys _has frequently been asked to answer during the last
few days_.)  what are you going to do?

  (mrs. mountcalm-villiers _enters_, _as usual in a flutter of
  excitement_.)

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  am i late?

  (_they brush her back into silence_.  elizabeth _takes charge of her_.)

annys.  (_she has risen_.)  you think it wise tactics, to make it
impossible for geoffrey to be anything else in the future but our enemy?

lady mogton.  (_contemptuously_.)  you are thinking of him, and not of
the cause.

annys.  and if i were!  havent i made sacrifice enough?more than any of
you will ever know.  ayand would make more, if i felt it was demanded of
me.  i dont!  (_her burst of anger is finished_.  _she turns_,
_smiling_.)  im much more cunning than you think.  there will be other
elections we shall want to fight.  with the under-secretary for home
affairs in sympathy with us, the government will find it difficult to
interfere.  dont you see how clever i am?

  (jawbones, _having received his instructions from_ phoebe, _has slipped
  out unobserved_.  _he has beckoned to_ ginger; _she has followed him_.
  phoebe _has joined the group_.)

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  theres something in that.

janet.  is mr. chilvers still in sympathy with us?

phoebe.  of course he is.  a bit rubbed up the wrong way just at present;
thats our fault.  when annys goes down, early next mouth, to fight the
exchange division of manchester, we shall have him with us.

                              (_a moment_.)

lady mogton.  where do you get that from?

phoebe.  from st. herbert.  the present member is his cousin.  they say
he cant live more than a week.

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  it really seems like providence.

annys.  (_has taken the opportunity of giving_ phoebe _a grateful squeeze
of the hand_.)

lady mogton.  you will fight manchester?

annys.  yes.  (_laughs_.)  and make myself a public nuisance if i win.

lady mogton.  well, must be content with that, i suppose.  better not
come in; the rooms rather crowded.  ill keep you informed how things
are going.

                  (_she goes out_, _followed by_ janet.)

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  ill stay with you, dear.

phoebe.  i want you to come and be photographed for the daily mirror.
the mans waiting downstairs.

elizabeth.  ill stop with annys.

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  im not quite sure, you know, that i take well
by flashlight.

phoebe.  you wait till youve seen mamma!  we must have you.  they want
you for the centre of the page.

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  well, if its really

phoebe.  (_to the others_.)  shall see you again.  (_she winks_.  _then
to_ mrs. mountcalm-villiers.)  we mustnt keep them waiting.  they are
giving us a whole page.

  (phoebe _takes_ mrs. mountcalm-villiers _out_.  elizabeth _has followed
  to the door_; _she closes it_.  annys _has reseated herself_, _facing
  the fire_.)

elizabeth.  when did you see your husband last?

annys.  not sincetuesday, wasnt it, that we went round to his rooms.
why?

elizabeth.  im thinking about manchester.  what was it he said to you?

annys.  oh, we were, both of us, a little over-excited, i suppose.  he
has(_she hesitates_, _finally answers_)he has always been so eager for
children.

elizabeth.  yes.  so many men are; not having to bear the pain and
inconvenience themselves.

annys.  oh, well, they have to provide for them when they do come.
thats fair enough division, i su  (_suddenly she turns fiercely_.)  why
do you talk like that?  as if we women were cowards.  do you think if god
sent me a child i should grudge him the price!

elizabeth.  do you want him to?

annys.  i dont know; prayed him to, once.

elizabeth.  (_she lays her hand upon her_.)  it isnt a few more mothers
that the world has need of.  it is the women whom god has appointedto
whom he has given freedom, that they may champion the cause of the
mothers, helpless by reason of their motherhood.

                    (_a moment_.  geoffrey _enters_.)

geoffrey.  good evening.

annys.  (_rises_; _a smile struggles for possession_.  _but he only
shakes hands_, _and it dies away_.)

elizabeth.  good evening.

                          (_they shake hands_.)

geoffrey.  you are not interested in the counting?

annys.  the room is rather crowded.  mamma thought i would be better out
here.  how have you been?

geoffrey.  oh, all right.  its going to be a very near thing, they tell
me.

annys.  yes, i shall be glad when its over.

geoffrey.  its always a trying time.  what are you going to do, if you
win?

                        (lady mogton _looks in_.)

lady mogton.  (_seeing_ geoffrey.)  oh, good evening.

geoffrey.  good evening.

lady mogton.  chilvers, 2,960annys chilvers, 2,874.

                                           (_she disappearscloses door_.)

annys.  perhaps im not going to win.  (_she goes to him_, _smiling_.)  i
hope youll win.  i would so much rather you won.

geoffrey.  very kind of you.  im afraid that wont make it a certainty.

annys.  (_his answer has hardened her again_.)  how can i?  it would not
be fair.  without your consent i should never have entered upon it.  it
was understood that the seat, in any case, would be yours.

geoffrey.  i would rather you considered yourself quite free.  in warfare
it doesnt pay to be fair to ones enemy.

annys.  (_still hardening_.)  besides, there is no need.  there will be
other opportunities.  i can contest some other constituency.  if i win,
claim the seat for that.

                              (_a moment_.)

geoffrey.  so this is only the beginning?  you have decided to devote
yourself to a political career?

annys.  why not?

geoffrey.  if i were to ask you to abandon it, to come back to your place
at my sidehelping me, strengthening me?

annys.  you mean you would have me abandon my own taskmerge myself in
you?

geoffrey.  be my wife.

annys.  it would not be right.  i, too, have my work.

geoffrey.  if it takes you away from me?

annys.  why need it take me away from you?  why cannot we work together
for common ends, each in our own way?

geoffrey.  we talked like that before we tried it.  marriage is not a
partnership; it is a leadership.

annys.  (_she looks at him_.)  you meanan ownership.

geoffrey.  perhaps youre right.  i didnt make it.  im onlybeginning
to understand it.

annys.  and i too.  it is not what i want.

geoffrey.  you mean its duties have become irksome to you.

annys.  i mean i want to be the judge myself of what are my duties.

geoffrey.  i no longer count.  you will go your way without me?

annys.  i must go the way i think right.

geoffrey.  (_he flings away_.)  if you win to-night you will do well to
make the most of it.  take my advice and claim the seat.

annys.  (_looks at him puzzled_.)

elizabeth.  why?

geoffrey.  because (_with a short_, _ugly laugh_) the lord only knows
when youll get another opportunity.

elizabeth.  you are going to stop us?

geoffrey.  to stop women from going to the poll.  the bill will be
introduced on monday.  carried through all its stages the same week.

elizabeth.  you think it will pass?

geoffrey.  the whips assure me that it will.

annys.  but they cannot, they dare not, without your assent.  the  (_the
light breaks in upon her_.)  who is bringing it in?

geoffrey.  i am.

annys.  (_is going to speak_.)

geoffrey.  (_he stops her_.)  oh, im prepared for all thatridicule,
abuse.  chilverss bill for the better regulation of mrs. chilvers,
theyll call it.  i can hear their laughter.  yours wont be among it.

annys.  but, geoffrey!  what is the meaning?  merely to spite me, are you
going to betray a cause that you have professed belief inthat you have
fought for?

geoffrey.  yesif it is going to take you away from me.  i want you.  no,
i dont want a frienda fellow-workersome interesting rival in well
doing.  i can get all that outside my home.  i want a wife.  i want the
woman i love to belong to meto be mine.  i am not troubling about being
up to date; im talking what i feelwhat every male creature must have
felt since the protoplasmic cell developed instincts.  i want a woman to
lovea woman to work fora woman to fight fora woman to be a slave to.
but minemine, and nothing else.  all the rest (_he makes a gesture_) is
talk.

  (_he closes the window_, _shutting out the hubbub of the crowd_.)

annys.  (_a strange_, _new light has stolen in_.  _she is bewildered_,
_groping_.)  butall this is new between us.  you have not talked like
this fornot since  we were just good friendscomrades.

geoffrey.  and might have remained so, god knows!  i suppose were made
like that.  so long as there was no danger passion slept.  i cannot
explain it.  i only know that now, beside the thought of losing you, all
else in the world seems meaningless.  the womans movement!  (_he makes a
gesture of contempt_.)  men have wrecked kingdoms for a woman before
nowand will again.  i want you!  (_he comes to her_.)  wont you come
back to me, that we may build up the home we used to dream of?  wasnt
the old love good?  what has this new love to give you?  work that man
can do better.  the cause of the womenthe children!  has woman loved
woman better than man?  will the world be better for the children, man
and woman contending?  come back to me.  help me.  help me to fight for
all good women.  teach me how i may make the world betterfor our
children.

annys.  (_the light is in her eyes_.  _she stands a moment_.  _her hands
are going out to him_.)

elizabeth.  (_she comes between them_.)  yes, go to him.  he will be very
good to you.  good men are kind to women, kind even to their dogs.  you
will be among the pampered few!  you will be happy.  and the others!
what does it matter?

  (_they draw apart_.  _she stands between them_, _the incarnation of the
  spirit of sex war_.)

the women that have not kind ownersthe dogs that have not kind
mastersthe dumb women, chained to their endless, unpaid drudgery!  let
them be content.  what are they but mans chattel?  to be honoured if it
pleases him, or to be cast into the dust.  mans pauper!  bound by his
laws, subject to his whim; her every hope, her every aspiration, owed to
his charity.  she toils for him without ceasing: it should be her
pleasure.  she bears him children, when he chooses to desire them.
they are his to do as he will by.  why seek to change it?  our man is
kind.  what have they to do with us: the women beaten, driven,
overtaskedthe women without hope or joy, the livers of grey lives that
men may laugh and spendthe women degraded lower than the beasts to
pander to the beast in manthe women outraged and abandoned, bearing to
the grave the burden of mans lust?  let them go their way.  they are but
our sisters of sorrow.  and we who could help themwe to whom god has
given the weapons: the brain, and the couragewe make answer: i have
married a husband, and i cannot come.

                              (_a silence_.)

geoffrey.  well, you have heard.  (_he makes a gesture_.)   what is your
answer?

annys.  (_she comes to him_.)  dont you love me enough to humour me a
littleto put up with my vexing ways?  i so want to help, to feel i am
doing just a little, to make the world kinder.  i know you can do it
better, but i want so to be in it.  (_she laughs_.)  let us forget all
this.  wake up to-morrow morning with fresh hearts.  you will be member
for east poplar.  and then you shall help me to win manchester.  (_she
puts her hands upon his breast_: _she would have him take her in his
arms_.)  i am not strong enough to fight alone.

geoffrey.  i want you.  let manchester find some one else.

annys.  (_she draws away from him_.)  and if i cannotwill not?

geoffrey.  i bring in my bill on monday.  well be quite frank about it.
that is my priceyou.  i want you!

annys.  you mean it comes to that: a whole cause dependent on a man and a
woman!

geoffrey.  yes, that is how the world is built.  on each man and woman.
how does it shape my life, my hopes?  so will each make answer.

              (lady mogton _enters_.  _she stands silent_.)

elizabeth.  is it over?

lady mogton.  annys chilvers, 3,604geoffrey chilvers, 3,590.

                            (janet _enters_.)

janet.  (_she rushes to_ annys, _embraces her_.)  youve won, youve won!
(_she flies to the window_, _opens it_, _and goes out on to the
balcony_.)

  (phoebe _enters_, _followed by_ mrs. mountcalm-villiers.)

phoebe.  is it true?

lady mogton.  pretty close.  majority of 14.

mrs. mountcalm-villiers.  for us?

lady mogton.  for us.

  (janet _by this time has announced the figures_.  _there is heard a
  great burst of cheering_, _renewed again and again_.)

janet.  (_re-entering_.)  they want you!  they want you!

  (_mingled with the cheering come cries of_ _speech_!  _speech_!)

lady mogton.  you must say something.

  (_the band strikes up_ _the conquering hero_.  _the women crowd
  round_ annys, _congratulating her_.  geoffrey _stands apart_.)

phoebe.  (_screaming above the din_.)  put on your cloak.

janet.  (_rushes and gets it_.)

                       (_they wrap it round her_.)

  (annys _goes out on to the balcony_, _followed by the other women_.
  elizabeth, _going last_, _fires a parting smile of triumph at_
  geoffrey.)

  _making a quick change_, _joins in_.  geoffrey _remains centre_.)

  (jawbones _enters unobserved_.  _the singing ends with three cheers_.
  annys _is speaking_.  geoffrey _turns and sees_ jawbones.)

geoffrey.  (_with a smile_.)  give me down my coat, will you?

jawbones.  (_he is sympathetic_.  _he helps him on with it_.)  shall i
get you a cab, sir?

geoffrey.  no, thanks.  ill pick one up.  (_he goes towards the door_,
_then stops_.)  is there any other way outnot through the main entrance?

jawbones.  yes, sir.  theres a side door opening on woodstock road.
ill show it you.

geoffrey.  thanks.  (_he follows_ jawbones _out_.)

the fourth act


scene:_russell square_.  _the morning-room_ (_on the ground floor_).  _a
small_, _cheerful room_, _furnished in chippendale_, _white panelled_,
_with adams fireplace in which a bright fire is burning_.  _two deep
easy-chairs are before the fire_.  _the window-curtains of red damask are
drawn_.  _an oval table occupies the centre of the room_.  _the door at
back opens upon the hall_.  _only one light burns_, _an electric lamp on
a table just above the fire_.

                            time:_midnight_.

(_the door opens_.  geoffrey _enters_.  _he has left his out-door things
in the hall_.  _he crosses and rings the bell_.  _a moment_.)

                             (hake _enters_.)

geoffrey.  oh, you, hake!  there wasnt any need for you to have stopped.

hake.  i was not sure of your arrangements.  i thought perhaps i might be
wanted.

geoffrey.  sorry.  i ought to have told you.

hake.  its been no inconvenience, sir.  i told mrs. hake not to sit up.

geoffrey.  (_he is opening and reading his letters left for him on the
table_.)  does she generally sit up for you?

hake.  as a rule, sir.  we like a little chat before going to bed.

geoffrey.  (_his eyes on a letter_.)  what do you find to chat about?

hake.  oh, there is so much for a husband and wife to talk about.  the
as a rule.

               (_a clock on the mantelpiece strikes one_.)

geoffrey.  whats that?

hake.  quarter past twelve, sir.

geoffrey.  has your mistress come in?

hake.  not yet, sir.  has the election gone all right, sir?

geoffrey.  for mrs. chilvers, yes.  she is now member for east poplar.

hake.  i am sorry.  it has been a great surprise to me.

geoffrey.  the result?

hake.  the whole thing, sir.  such a sweet lady, we all thought her.

geoffrey.  life, hake, is a surprising affair.

                           (_a ring is heard_.)

i expect thats she.  she has forgotten her key.

                            (hake _goes out_.)

  (geoffrey _continues his letters_.  _a few moments pass_; hake
  _re-enters_, _closes the door_.)

hake.  (_he seems puzzled_.)  its a lady, sir

                           (geoffrey _turns_.)

hake.  at leasthardly a lady.  a mrs. chinn.

geoffrey.  mrs. chinn!  (_he glances at his watch_.)  at twelve oclock
at night.  well, all right.  ill see her.

  (hake _opens the door_, _speaks to_ mrs. chinn.  _she enters_, _in
  bonnet and shawl_.)

hake.  mrs. chinn.

geoffrey.  good evening, mrs. chinn.

mrs. chinn.  good evening, sir.

geoffrey.  you neednt stop, hake.  i shant be wanting anything.

hake.  thank you.

geoffrey.  apologise for me to mrs. hake.  good-night.

hake.  good-night, sir.

  (hake _goes out_.  _a minute later the front door is heard to slam_.)

geoffrey.  wont you sit down?  (_he puts a chair for her left of the
table_.)

mrs. chinn.  (_seating herself_.)  thank you, sir.

geoffrey.  (_he half sits on the arm of the easy-chair below the fire_.)
whats the trouble?

mrs. chinn.  its my boy, sirmy youngest.  hes been taking money that
didnt belong to him.

geoffrey.  um.  has it been going on for long?

mrs. chinn.  about six months, sir.  i only heard of it to-night.  you
see, his wife died a year ago.  she was such a good manager.  and after
she was gone he seems to have got into debt.

geoffrey.  what were his wages?

mrs. chinn.  nineteen shillings a week, sir.  and that with the rent and
three young childrenwell, it wants thinking out.

geoffrey.  from whom did he take the moneyhis employers?

mrs. chinn.  yes, sir.  he was the carman.  they had always trusted him
to collect the accounts.

geoffrey.  how much, would you say, was the defalcation?

mrs. chinn.  i beg pardon, sir.

geoffrey.  how much does it amount to, the sums that he has taken?

mrs. chinn.  six pounds, sir, mr. cohen says it comes to.

geoffrey.  wont they accept repayment?

mrs. chinn.  yes, sir.  mr. cohen has been very nice about it.  he is
going to let me pay it off by instalments.

geoffrey.  well, then, that gets over most of the trouble.

mrs. chinn.  well, you see, sir, unfortunately, mr. cohen gave
information to the police the moment he discovered it.

geoffrey.  umph!  cant he say he made a mistake?

mrs. chinn.  they say it must go for trial, sir.  that he can only
withdraw the charge in court.

geoffrey.  um!

mrs. chinn.  you see, sira thing like that(_she recovers herself_.)  it
clings to a lad.

geoffrey.  what do you want me to do?

mrs. chinn.  well, sir, i thought that, perhapsyou see, sir, he has got
a brother in canada who would help him; and i thought that if i could
ship him off

geoffrey.  you want me to tip the wink to the police to look the other
way while you smuggle this young malefactor out of the clutches of the
law?

mrs. chinn.  (_quite indifferent to the moral aspect of the case_.)  if
you would be so kind, sir.

geoffrey.  umph!  i suppose you know what youre doing; appealing through
your womanhood to mans weaknessemploying backstairs influence to gain
your private ends, indifferent to the higher issues of the public weal?
all the things that are going to cease when woman has the vote.

mrs. chinn.  you see, sir, hes the youngest.

  (_gradually the decent but dingy figure of_ mrs. chinn _has taken to
  itself new shape_.  _to_ geoffrey, _it almost seems as though there
  were growing out of the shadows over against him the figure of great
  artemis herselfartemis of the thousand breasts_.  _he had returned
  home angry_, _bitter against all women_.  _as she unfolds her simple
  tale understanding comes to him_.  _so long as there are_ _mrs.
  chinns_ _in the world_, _woman claims homage_.)

geoffrey.  how many were there?

mrs. chinn.  ten altogether, six living.

geoffrey.  been a bit of a struggle for you, hasnt it?

mrs. chinn.  it has been a bit difficult, at times; especially after
their poor father died.

geoffrey.  how many were you left with?

mrs. chinn.  eight, sir.

geoffrey.  how on earth did you manage to keep them?

mrs. chinn.  well, you see, sir, the two eldest, they were earning a
little.  i dont think i could have done it without that.

geoffrey.  wasnt there any source from which you could have obtained
help?  what was your husband?

mrs. chinn.  he worked in the shipyards, sir.  there was some talk about
it.  but, of course, that always means taking the children away from you.

geoffrey.  would not that have been better for them?

mrs. chinn.  not always, sir.  of course, if i hadnt been able to do my
duty by them i should have had to.  but, thank god, ive always been
strong.

geoffrey.  (_he rises_.)  i will see what can be done.

mrs. chinn.  thank you, sir.

geoffrey.  (_half-way_, _he turns_.)  when does the next boat sailfor
canada?

mrs. chinn.  to-morrow night, sir, from glasgow.  i have booked his
passage.

geoffrey.  (_with a smile_.)  you seem to have taken everything for
granted.

mrs. chinn.  you see, sir, its the disgrace.  all the others are doing
so well.  it would upset them so.

                             (_he goes out_.)

                          (_there is a moment_.)

         (annys _enters_.  _she is wearing her outdoor things_.)

annys.  mrs. chinn!

mrs. chinn.  (_she has risen_; _she curtseys_.)  good evening, maam.

annys.  (_she is taking off her hat_.)  nothing wrong, is there?

mrs. chinn.  my boy, maam, my youngest, has been getting into trouble.

annys.  (_she pauses_, _her hat in her hand_.)  they will, wont they?
its nothing serious, i hope?

mrs. chinn.  i think it will be all right, maam, thanks to your good
gentleman.

annys.  (_she lays aside her hat_.)  you have had a good many children,
havent you, mrs. chinn?

mrs. chinn.  ten altogether, maam; six living.

annys.  can one love ten, all at once?

  (_the cloak has fallen aside_.  mrs. chinn _is a much experienced
  lady_.)

mrs. chinn.  just as many as come, dear.  god sends the love with them.

  (_there is a moment_; _the two women are very close to one another_.
  _then_ annys _gives a little cry and somehow their arms are round one
  another_.)

  (_she mothers her into the easy chair above the fire_; _places a
  footstool under her feet_.)  you have your cry out, dearie, it will do
  you good.

annys.  you look so strong and great.

mrs. chinn.  its the tears, dearie.  (_she arranges the foot-stool_.)
you keep your feet up.

  (_the handle of the door is heard_.  mrs. chinn _is standing beside her
  own chair_.  _she is putting back her handkerchief into her bag_.)

                         (geoffrey _re-enters_.)

  (annys _is hidden in the easy chair_.  _he does not see her_.)

geoffrey.  well, mrs. chinn, an exhaustive search for the accused will be
commencednext week.

mrs. chinn.  thank you, sir.

geoffrey.  what about the childrenare they going with him?

mrs. chinn.  no, sir; i thought he would be better without them till
everything is settled.

geoffrey.  who is taking care of themyou?

mrs. chinn.  yes, sir.

geoffrey.  and the passage moneyhow much was that?

mrs. chinn.  four pound fifteen.

geoffrey.  would you mind my coming in, as a friend?

mrs. chinn.  well, if you dont mind, id rather not.  ive always done
everything for the children myself.  its been a fad of mine.

geoffrey.  (_he makes a gesture of despair_.)  you mothers!  youre so
greedy.  (_he holds out his hand_, _smiling_.)  goodbye.

mrs. chinn.  (_she takes his hand in hers_.)  god bless you, sir.  and
your good lady.

geoffrey.  (_as he takes her to the door_.)  how will you get home?

mrs. chinn.  i can get the underground from gower street, sir.

  (_they go out talking about last trains and leaving the door open_.
  _the next moment the front door is heard to slam_.)

                         (geoffrey _re-enters_.)

  (annys _has moved round_, _so that coming back into the room he finds
  her there_.)

geoffrey.  how long have you been in?

                                                   (_he closes the door_.)

annys.  only a few minuteswhile you were at the telephone.  i had to
rest for a little while.  dr. whitby brought me back in his motor.

geoffrey.  was he down there?

annys.  phoebe had sent for him.  i had been taken a little giddy earlier
in the day.

geoffrey.  (_he grunts_.  _he is fighting with his tenderness_.)  dont
wonder at it.  all this overwork and excitement.

annys.  im afraid ive been hurting you.

geoffrey.  (_still growling_.)  both been hurting each other, i expect.

annys.  (_she smiles_.)  its so easy to hurt those that love us.

  (_she makes a little movement_, _feebly stretches out her arms to him_.
  _wondering_, _he comes across to her_.  _she draws him down beside
  her_, _takes his arms and places them about her_.)  i want to feel that
  i belong to you.  that you are strong.  that i can rest upon you.

geoffrey.  (_he cannot understand_.)  but only an hour ago(_he looks at
her_.)  have you, too, turned traitor to the womans cause?

annys.  (_she answers smiling_.)  no.  but woman, dear, is a much more
complicated person than i thought her.  it is only in this hour that god
has revealed her to me.  (_she draws him closer_.)  i want you, deardear
husband.  take care of usboth, wont you?  i love you, i love you.  i
did not know how much.

geoffrey.  (_he gathers her to him_, _kissing her_, _crooning over her_.)
oh, my dear, my dear!  my little one, my love, my wife!

annys.  (_she is laughing_, _crying_.)  but, geoffrey, dear

                        (_he tries to calm her_.)

no, let me.  i want to  and then ill be quite good, i promise  its
only fair to warn you.  when im strong and can think again, i shall
still want the vote.  i shall want it more than ever.

geoffrey.  (_he answers with a happy laugh_, _holding her in his arms_.)

annys.  you will help us?  because its right, dear, isnt it?  he will
be my child as well as yours.  you will let me help you make the world
better for our childand for all the childrenand for all the mothersand
for all the dear, kind men: you will, wont you?

geoffrey.  i thought you were drifting away from me: that strange voices
were calling you away from life and motherhood.  god has laughed at my
fears.  he has sent you back to me with his command.  we will fashion his
world together, we two lovers, man and woman, joined together in all
things.  it is his will.  his chains are the childrens hands.

                (_kneeling_, _he holds her in his arms_.)

                           (the curtain falls.)

goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future
generations. to learn more about the project gutenberg literary

section 4. information about donations to the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation

project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states. compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. to send
donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states. u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. to
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

section 5. general information about project gutenberg-tm electronic works.

professor michael s. hart was the originator of the project
gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. for forty years, he produced and
distributed project gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the u.s. unless a copyright notice is included. thus, we do not
necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

most people start at our web site which has the main pg search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

this web site includes information about project gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation, how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks.
