judgment. some consider taste as a mere sensibility, and others as a
simple exercise of judgment; but a union of both is requisite to the
existence of anything which deserves the name. an original sense of the
beautiful is just as necessary to sthetic judgments, as a sense of
right and wrong to the formation of any just conclusions on moral
subjects. but this "sense of the beautiful" is not an arbitrary
principle. it is under the guidance of reason; it grows in delicacy and
correctness with the progress of the individual and of society at
large; it has its laws, which are seated in the nature of man; and it
is in the development of these laws that we find the true "standard of
taste."

what, then, is taste, but those internal powers, active and strong, and
feelingly alive to each fine impulse? a discerning sense of decent and
sublime, with quick disgust from things deformed, or disarranged, or
gross in species? this, nor gems, nor stores of gold, nor purple state,
nor culture, can bestow, but god alone, when first his active hand
imprints the secret bias of the soul.

leaves of a shrub, or small tree (thea, or camellia, chinensis). the

teas are classed as green or black, according to their color or
appearance, the kinds being distinguished also by various other
characteristic differences, as of taste, odor, and the like. the color,
flavor, and quality are dependent upon the treatment which the leaves
receive after being gathered. the leaves for green tea are heated, or
roasted slightly, in shallow pans over a wood fire, almost immediately
after being gathered, after which they are rolled with the hands upon a
table, to free them from a portion of their moisture, and to twist
them, and are then quickly dried. those intended for black tea are
spread out in the air for some time after being gathered, and then
tossed about with the hands until they become soft and flaccid, when
they are roasted for a few minutes, and rolled, and having then been
exposed to the air for a few hours in a soft and moist state, are
finally dried slowly over a charcoal fire. the operation of roasting
and rolling is sometimes repeated several times, until the leaves have
become of the proper color. the principal sorts of green tea are
twankay, the poorest kind; hyson skin, the refuse of hyson; hyson,
imperial, and gunpowder, fine varieties; and young hyson, a choice kind
made from young leaves gathered early in the spring. those of black tea
are bohea, the poorest kind; congou; oolong; souchong, one of the
finest varieties; and pekoe, a fine-flavored kind, made chiefly from
young spring buds. see bohea, congou, gunpowder tea, under gunpowder,
hyson, oolong, and souchong. k. johnson. tomlinson.

"no knowledge of . . . [tea] appears to have reached europe till after
the establishment of intercourse between portugal and china in 1517.

at bantam early in 17th century, that these adventurers learned from
the chinese the habit of tea drinking, and brought it to europe."

or ideas, or by means of words and signs, transmitted by electrical
action.

the instruments used are classed as indicator, type- printing,
symbol-printing, or chemical-printing telegraphs, according as the
intelligence is given by the movements of a pointer or indicator, as in
cooke & wheatstone's (the form commonly used in england), or by
impressing, on a fillet of paper, letters from types, as in house's and
hughe's, or dots and marks from a sharp point moved by a magnet, as in
morse's, or symbols produced by electro-chemical action, as in bain's.
in the offices in the united states the recording instrument is now
little used, the receiving operator reading by ear the combinations of
long and short intervals of sound produced by the armature of an
electro- magnet as it is put in motion by the opening and breaking of

tel"e*pheme (?), n. [gr. &?; afar + &?; a saying.] a message by a
telephone. [recent]

tel"e*phone (?), n. [gr. &?; far off + &?; sound.] (physics) an
instrument for reproducing sounds, especially articulate speech, at a
distance.

the ordinary telephone consists essentially of a device by which
currents of electricity, produced by sounds through the agency of
certain mechanical devices and exactly corresponding in duration and
intensity to the vibrations of the air which attend them, are
transmitted to a distant station, and there, acting on suitable
mechanism, reproduce similar sounds by repeating the vibrations. the
necessary variations in the electrical currents are usually produced by
means of a microphone attached to a thin diaphragm upon which the voice
acts, and are intensified by means of an induction coil. in the
magnetic telephone, or magneto- telephone, the diaphragm is of soft
iron placed close to the pole of a magnet upon which is wound a coil of
fine wire, and its vibrations produce corresponding vibrable currents
in the wire by induction. the mechanical, or string, telephone is a
device in which the voice or sound causes vibrations in a thin
diaphragm, which are directly transmitted along a wire or string
connecting it to a similar diaphragm at the remote station, thus
reproducing the sound. it does not employ electricity.

tel"e*phone, v. t. to convey or announce by telephone.

crystalline compound related to, or produced from, erythrin. so called
because regarded as the end of the series of erythrin compounds.

tel"e*scope (?), n. [gr. &?; viewing afar, farseeing; &?; far, far off
+ &?; a watcher, akin to &?; to view: cf. f. telescope. see telegraph,
and -scope.] an optical instrument used in viewing distant objects, as
the heavenly bodies.

a telescope assists the eye chiefly in two ways; first, by enlarging
the visual angle under which a distant object is seen, and thus
magnifying that object; and, secondly, by collecting, and conveying to
the eye, a larger beam of light than would enter the naked organ, thus
rendering objects distinct and visible which would otherwise be
indistinct and or invisible. its essential parts are the object glass,
or concave mirror, which collects the beam of light, and forms an image
of the object, and the eyeglass, which is a microscope, by which the
image is magnified.

achromatic telescope. see under achromatic.  aplanatic telescope, a
telescope having an aplanatic eyepiece.  astronomical telescope, a
telescope which has a simple eyepiece so constructed or used as not to

objects inverted, which is not a hindrance in astronomical
observations.  cassegrainian telescope, a reflecting telescope
invented by cassegrain, which differs from the gregorian only in having
the secondary speculum convex instead of concave, and placed nearer the
large speculum. the cassegrainian represents objects inverted; the
gregorian, in their natural position. the melbourne telescope (see
illust. under reflecting telescope, below) is a cassegrainian
telescope.  dialytic telescope. see under dialytic. - - equatorial
telescope. see the note under equatorial.  galilean telescope, a
refracting telescope in which the eyeglass is a concave instead of a
convex lens, as in the common opera glass. this was the construction
originally adopted by galileo, the inventor of the instrument. it
exhibits the objects erect, that is, in their natural positions. 
gregorian telescope, a form of reflecting telescope. see under
gregorian.  herschelian telescope, a reflecting telescope of the form
invented by sir william herschel, in which only one speculum is
employed, by means of which an image of the object is formed near one
side of the open end of the tube, and to this the eyeglass is applied
directly.  newtonian telescope, a form of reflecting telescope. see
under newtonian.  photographic telescope, a telescope specially
constructed to make photographs of the heavenly bodies.  prism
telescope. see teinoscope.  reflecting telescope, a telescope in which
the image is formed by a speculum or mirror (or usually by two
speculums, a large one at the lower end of the telescope, and the
smaller one near the open end) instead of an object glass. see
gregorian, cassegrainian, herschelian,  newtonian, telescopes, above.

refraction through an object glass.  telescope carp (zool.), the
telescope fish.  telescope fish (zool.), a monstrous variety of the

by the judicature acts of 1873, 1875, which provide for the more

states, the terms to be observed by the tribunals of justice are

6. (logic) the subject or the predicate of a proposition; one of the

sir w. hamilton.

the predicate of the conclusion is called the major term, because it is
the most general, and the subject of the conclusion is called the minor
term, because it is less general. these are called the extermes; and
the third term, introduced as a common measure between them, is called
the mean or middle term. thus in the following syllogism, 

every vegetable is combustible; every tree is a vegetable; therefore
every tree is combustible, -

combustible, the predicate of the conclusion, is the major term; tree
is the minor term; vegetable is the middle term.

syn.  limit; bound; boundary; condition; stipulation; word;
expression.  term, word. these are more frequently interchanged than
almost any other vocables that occur of the language. there is,
however, a difference between them which is worthy of being kept in
mind. word is generic; it denotes an utterance which represents or
expresses our thoughts and feelings. term originally denoted one of the
two essential members of a proposition in logic, and hence signifies a
word of specific meaning, and applicable to a definite class of
objects. thus, we may speak of a scientific or a technical term, and of
stating things in distinct terms. thus we say, "the term minister
literally denotes servant;" "an exact definition of terms is essential
to clearness of thought;" "no term of reproach can sufficiently express
my indignation;" "every art has its peculiar and distinctive terms,"
etc. so also we say, "purity of style depends on the choice of words,
and precision of style on a clear understanding of the terms used."
term is chiefly applied to verbs, nouns, and adjectives, these being
capable of standing as terms in a logical proposition; while
prepositions and conjunctions, which can never be so employed, are
rarely spoken of as terms, but simply as words.

2. the alternate rising and falling of the waters of the ocean, and of
bays, rivers, etc., connected therewith. the tide ebbs and flows twice
in each lunar day, or the space of a little more than twenty-four
hours. it is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and moon (the
influence of the latter being three times that of the former), acting
unequally on the waters in different parts of the earth, thus
disturbing their equilibrium. a high tide upon one side of the earth is
accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. hence, when the sun
and moon are in conjunction or opposition, as at new moon and full
moon, their action is such as to produce a greater than the usual tide,
called the spring tide, as represented in the cut. when the moon is in
the first or third quarter, the sun's attraction in part counteracts
the effect of the moon's attraction, thus producing under the moon a
smaller tide than usual, called the neap tide.

double tides. see under work, v. t.  tide day, the interval between
the occurrences of two consecutive maxima of the resultant wave at the
same place. its length varies as the components of sun and moon waves
approach to, or recede from, one another. a retardation from this cause
is called the lagging of the tide, while the acceleration of the
recurrence of high water is termed the priming of the tide. see lag of
the tide, under 2d lag.  tide dial, a dial to exhibit the state of the

formation of compound verbs; as in to-beat, to-break, to-hew, to- rend,
to-tear. see these words in the vocabulary. see the note on all to, or
all-to, under all, adv.

to (&?;, emphatic or alone, &?;, obscure or unemphatic), prep. [as. t;

& gael. do, ol. -do, -du, as in endo, indu, in, gr. &?;, as in &?;
homeward. 200. cf. too, tatoo a beat of drums.] 1. the preposition to
primarily indicates approach and arrival, motion made in the direction

state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being regarded as a
limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going to a trade;
he is rising to wealth and honor.

3. in a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of
application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or
indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs
with a following noun which limits their action. its sphere verges upon
that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or appropriation;
as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us keep this
seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste; an event painful to
the mind; duty to god and to our parents; a dislike to spirituous
liquor.

4. as sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last
defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it
as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to
go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; i do my
utmost to lead my life pleasantly. but it has come to be the almost
constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it has no
prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object or
subject; thus, i love to learn, i.e., i love learning; to die for one's
country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. where the
infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed
the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out for see? (matt.
xi. 8).

then longen folk to go on pilgrimages, and palmers for to seeken
strange stranders.

chaucer.

such usage is now obsolete or illiterate. in colloquial usage, to often
stands for, and supplies, an infinitive already mentioned; thus, he
commands me to go with him, but i do not wish to.

5. in many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to has a
pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically. thus, it denotes or implies:
(a) extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as; as,
they met us to the number of three hundred.

to in to-day, to-night, and to-morrow has the sense or force of for or
on; for, or on, (this) day, for, or on, (this) night, for, or on, (the)

the use of the word tone, both for a sound and for the interval between
two sounds or tones, is confusing, but is common  almost universal.

nearly every musical sound is composite, consisting of several
simultaneous tones having different rates of vibration according to
fixed laws, which depend upon the nature of the vibrating body and the
mode of excitation. the components (of a composite sound) are called
partial tones; that one having the lowest rate of vibration is the
fundamental tone, and the other partial tones are called harmonics, or
overtones. the vibration ratios of the partial tones composing any
sound are expressed by all, or by a part, of the numbers in the series
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.; and the quality of any sound (the tone color) is
due in part to the presence or absence of overtones as represented in
this series, and in part to the greater or less intensity of those
present as compared with the fundamental tone and with one another.
resultant tones, combination tones, summation tones, difference tones,
tartini's tones (terms only in part synonymous) are produced by the
simultaneous sounding of two or more primary (simple or composite)
tones.

5. (med.) that state of a body, or of any of its organs or parts, in

trade comprehends every species of exchange or dealing, either in the
produce of land, in manufactures, in bills, or in money; but it is
chiefly used to denote the barter or purchase and sale of goods, wares,
and merchandise, either by wholesale or retail. trade is either foreign
or domestic. foreign trade consists in the exportation and importation
of goods, or the exchange of the commodities of different countries.
domestic, or home, trade is the exchange, or buying and selling, of
goods within a country. trade is also by the wholesale, that is, by the
package or in large quantities, generally to be sold again, or it is by
retail, or in small parcels. the carrying trade is the business of
transporting commodities from one country to another, or between places

the general direction of the trade winds is from n. e. to s. w. on the
north side of the equator, and from s. e. to n. w. on the south side of
the equator. they are produced by the joint effect of the rotation of
the earth and the movement of the air from the polar toward the
equatorial regions, to supply the vacancy caused by heating,
rarefaction, and consequent ascent of the air in the latter regions.
the trade winds are principally limited to two belts in the tropical
regions, one on each side of the equator, and separated by a belt which
is characterized by calms or variable weather.

syn.  transcendental, empirical. these terms, with the corresponding
nouns, transcendentalism and empiricism, are of comparatively recent
origin. empirical refers to knowledge which is gained by the experience
of actual phenomena, without reference to the principles or laws to
which they are to be referred, or by which they are to be explained.
transcendental has reference to those beliefs or principles which are
not derived from experience, and yet are absolutely necessary to make
experience possible or useful. such, in the better sense of the term,
is the transcendental philosophy, or transcendentalism. each of these
words is also used in a bad sense, empiricism applying to that
one-sided view of knowledge which neglects or loses sight of the truths
or principles referred to above, and trusts to experience alone;
transcendentalism, to the opposite extreme, which, in its deprecation
of experience, loses sight of the relations which facts and phenomena
sustain to principles, and hence to a kind of philosophy, or a use of
language, which is vague, obscure, fantastic, or extravagant.

transcendentalismus.] 1. (kantian philos.) the transcending, or going
beyond, empiricism, and ascertaining a priori the fundamental
principles of human knowledge.

as schelling and hegel claim to have discovered the absolute identity
of the objective and subjective in human knowledge, or of things and
human conceptions of them, the kantian distinction between transcendent
and transcendental ideas can have no place in their philosophy; and
hence, with them, transcendentalism claims to have a true knowledge of
all things, material and immaterial, human and divine, so far as the
mind is capable of knowing them. and in this sense the word
transcendentalism is now most used. it is also sometimes used for that
which is vague and illusive in philosophy.

point system of type bodies (type founding), a system adopted by the
type founders of the united states by which the various sizes of type
have been so modified and changed that each size bears an exact
proportional relation to every other size. the system is a modification
of a french system, and is based on the pica body. this pica body is
divided into twelfths, which are termed "points," and every type body
consist of a given number of these points. many of the type founders
indicate the new sizes of type by the number of points, and the old
names are gradually being done away with. by the point system type
founders cast type of a uniform size and height, whereas formerly fonts
of pica or other type made by different founders would often vary
slightly so that they could not be used together. there are no type in
actual use corresponding to the smaller theoretical sizes of the point
system. in some cases, as in that of ruby, the term used designates a
different size from that heretofore so called.

u.

u (), the twenty-first letter of the english alphabet, is a cursive
form of the letter v, with which it was formerly used interchangeably,
both letters being then used both as vowels and consonants. u and v are
now, however, differentiated, u being used only as a vowel or
semivowel, and v only as a consonant. the true primary vowel sound of
u, in anglo-saxon, was the sound which it still retains in most of the
languages of europe, that of long oo, as in tool, and short oo, as in
wood, answering to the french ou in tour. etymologically u is most
closely related to o, y (vowel), w, and v; as in two, duet, dyad,

(c) to present particles which come from intransitive verbs, or are
themselves employed as adjectives, to mark the absence of the activity,
disposition, or condition implied by the participle; as, -

 and the like.

the above classes of words are unlimited in extent, and such compounds
may be formed by any writer or speaker at will from almost all the
adjectives or participles in the language, excepting those which have a
recognized and usual negative correspondent with the prefix -in. no
attempt will be made, therefore, to define them all in this dictionary;
many will be omitted from its vocabulary which are negations of the
simple word, and are readily explained by prefixing a not to the
latter. derivatives of these words in -ly and -ness will also, for the
most part, be omitted for the same or similar reasons.

there will be inserted as separate articles with definitions, the
following: 

1. those which have acquired an opposed or contrary, instead of a
merely negative, meaning; as, unfriendly, ungraceful, unpalatable,
unquiet, and the like; or else an intensive sense more than a prefixed
not would express; as, unending, unparalleled, undisciplined,
undoubted, unsafe, and the like.

2. those which have the value of independent words, inasmuch as the
simple words are either not used at all, or are rarely, or at least
much less frequently, used; as, unavoidable, unconscionable,
undeniable, unspeakable, unprecedented, unruly, and the like; or
inasmuch as they are used in a different sense from the usual meaning
of the primitive, or especially in one of the significations of the
latter; as, unaccountable, unalloyed, unbelieving, unpretending,
unreserved, and the like; or inasmuch as they are so frequently and
familiarly used that they are hardly felt to be of negative origin; as,
uncertain, uneven, and the like.

3. those which are anomalous, provincial, or, for some other reason,
not desirable to be used, and are so indicated; as, unpure for impure,
unsatisfaction for dissatisfaction, unexpressible for inexpressible,
and the like.

ii. un- is prefixed to nouns to express the absence of, or the contrary
of, that which the noun signifies; as, unbelief, unfaith, unhealth,
unrest, untruth, and the like.

compounds of this last class are given in full in their proper order in
the vocabulary.

undulatory theory, or wave theory (of light) (opt.), that theory which
regards its various phenomena as due to undulations in an ethereal
medium, propagated from the radiant with immense, but measurable,
velocities, and producing different impressions on the retina according
to their amplitude and frequency, the sensation of brightness depending
on the former, that of color on the latter. the undulations are
supposed to take place, not in the direction of propagation, as in the
air waves constituting sound, but transversely, and the various
phenomena of refraction, polarization, interference, etc., are
attributable to the different affections of these undulations in
different circumstances of propagation. it is computed that the
frequency of the undulations corresponding to the several colors of the
spectrum ranges from 458 millions of millions per second for the
extreme red ray, to 727 millions of millions for the extreme violet,
and their lengths for the same colors, from the thirty-eight thousandth
to the sixty thousandth part of an inch. the theory of ethereal

to those of heat.

from the roman words universitas, collegium, corpus, are derived the
terms university, college, and corporation, of modern languages; and
though these words have obtained modified significations in modern
times, so as to be indifferently applicable to the same things, they
all agree in retaining the fundamental signification of the terms,
whatever may have been added to them. there is now no university,
college, or corporation, which is not a juristical person in the sense
above explained [see def. 2, above]; wherever these words are applied
to any association of persons not stamped with this mark, it is an
abuse of terms. eng. cyc.

syn.  custom; use; habit.  usage, custom. these words, as here
compared, agree in expressing the idea of habitual practice; but a
custom is not necessarily a usage. a custom may belong to many, or to a
single individual. a usage properly belongs to the great body of a
people. hence, we speak of usage, not of custom, as the law of
language. again, a custom is merely that which has been often repeated,
so as to have become, in a good degree, established. a usage must be
both often repeated and of long standing. hence, we speak of a "hew
custom," but not of a "new usage." thus, also, the "customs of society"
is not so strong an expression as the "usages of society." "custom, a
greater power than nature, seldom fails to make them worship." locke.
"of things once received and confirmed by use, long usage is a law
sufficient." hooker. in law, the words usage and custom are often used
interchangeably, but the word custom also has a technical and
restricted sense. see custom, n., 3.

syn.  employ.  use, employ. we use a thing, or make use of it, when
we derive from it some enjoyment or service. we employ it when we turn
that service into a particular channel. we use words to express our
general meaning; we employ certain technical terms in reference to a
given subject. to make use of, implies passivity in the thing; as, to
make use of a pen; and hence there is often a material difference
between the two words when applied to persons. to speak of "making use
of another" generally implies a degrading idea, as if we had used him
as a tool; while employ has no such sense. a confidential friend is
employed to negotiate; an inferior agent is made use of on an intrigue.

the use of money.

the practice of requiring in repayment of money lent anything more than
the amount lent, was formerly thought to be a great moral wrong, and
the greater, the more was taken. now it is not deemed more wrong to
take pay for the use of money than for the use of a house, or a horse,
or any other property. but the lingering influence of the former
opinion, together with the fact that the nature of money makes it
easier for the lender to oppress the borrower, has caused nearly all
christian nations to fix by law the rate of compensation for the use of
money. of late years, however, the opinion that money should be
borrowed and repaid, or bought and sold, upon whatever terms the
parties should agree to, like any other property, has gained ground
everywhere. am. cyc.

v (v). 1. v, the twenty-second letter of the english alphabet, is a
vocal consonant. v and u are only varieties of the same character, u
being the cursive form, while v is better adapted for engraving, as in
stone. the two letters were formerly used indiscriminately, and till a
comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed
together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see u). the
letter v is from the latin alphabet, where it was used both as a
consonant (about like english w) and as a vowel. the latin derives it
from it from a form (v) of the greek vowel (see y), this greek letter
being either from the same semitic letter as the digamma f (see f), or
else added by the greeks to the alphabet which they took from the
semitic. etymologically v is most nearly related to u, w, f, b, p; as
in vine, wine; avoirdupois, habit, have; safe, save; trover,
troubadour, trope. see u, f, etc.

power of an atom (or radical) as shown by the number of atoms of
hydrogen (or of other monads, as chlorine, sodium, etc.) with which it
will combine, or for which it can be substituted, or with which it can
be compared; thus, an atom of hydrogen is a monad, and has a valence of
one; the atoms of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon are respectively dyads,
triads, and tetrads, and have a valence respectively of two, three, and
four.

1. (physics) any substance in the gaseous, or aeriform, state, the
condition of which is ordinarily that of a liquid or solid.

the term vapor is sometimes used in a more extended sense, as identical
with gas; and the difference between the two is not so much one of kind
as of degree, the latter being applied to all permanently elastic
fluids except atmospheric air, the former to those elastic fluids which
lose that condition at ordinary temperatures. the atmosphere contains
more or less vapor of water, a portion of which, on a reduction of
temperature, becomes condensed into liquid water in the form of rain or
dew. the vapor of water produced by boiling, especially in its economic
relations, is called steam.

vapor is any substance in the gaseous condition at the maximum of
density consistent with that condition. this is the strict and proper
meaning of the word vapor.

subdivision, or peculiar form, of a species.

varieties usually differ from species in that any two, however unlike,
will generally propagate indefinitely (unless they are in their nature
unfertile, as some varieties of rose and other cultivated plants); in
being a result of climate, food, or other extrinsic conditions or
influences, but generally by a sudden, rather than a gradual,
development; and in tending in many cases to lose their distinctive
peculiarities when the individuals are left to a state of nature, and
especially if restored to the conditions that are natural to typical
individuals of the species. many varieties of domesticated animals and
of cultivated plants have been directly produced by man.

(d) in inorganic nature, one of those forms in which a species may
occur, which differ in minor characteristics of structure, color,
purity of composition, etc.

perfect and purest form, or, as is more commonly the case, all the
forms, including the latter, may rank as varieties. thus, the sapphire
is a blue variety, and the ruby a red variety, of corundum; again,
calcite has many varieties differing in form and structure, as iceland
spar, dogtooth spar, satin spar, and also others characterized by the
presence of small quantities of magnesia, iron, manganese, etc. still
again, there are varieties of granite differing in structure, as
graphic granite, porphyritic granite, and other varieties differing in
composition, as albitic granite, hornblendic, or syenitic, granite,
etc.

geographical variety (biol.), a variety of any species which is
coincident with a geographical region, and is usually dependent upon,
or caused by, peculiarities of climate.  variety hybrid (biol.), a
cross between two individuals of different varieties of the same
species; a mongrel.

syn.  diversity; difference; kind.  variety, diversity. a man has a
variety of employments when he does many things which are not a mere
repetition of the same act; he has a diversity of employments when the
several acts performed are unlike each other, that is, diverse. in most
cases, where there is variety there will be more or less of diversity,
but not always. one who sells railroad tickets performs a great variety
of acts in a day, while there is but little diversity in his
employment.

vegetable kingdom (nat. hist.), that primary division of living things
which includes all plants. the classes of the vegetable kingdom have
been grouped differently by various botanists. the following is one of
the best of the many arrangements of the principal subdivisions.

i. phnogamia (called also phanerogamia). plants having distinct
flowers and true seeds. { 1. dicotyledons (called also exogens). 
seeds with two or more cotyledons. stems with the pith, woody fiber,
and bark concentrically arranged. divided into two subclasses:
angiosperms, having the woody fiber interspersed with dotted or annular
ducts, and the seed contained in a true ovary; gymnosperms, having few
or no ducts in the woody fiber, and the seeds naked. 2. monocotyledons
(called also endogens).  seeds with single cotyledon. stems with
slender bundles of woody fiber not concentrically arranged, and with no
true bark.}

ii. cryptogamia. plants without true flowers, and reproduced by minute
spores of various kinds, or by simple cell division. { 1. acrogens. 
plants usually with distinct stems and leaves, existing in two
alternate conditions, one of which is nonsexual and sporophoric, the
other sexual and oophoric. divided into vascular acrogens, or
pteridophyta, having the sporophoric plant conspicuous and consisting
partly of vascular tissue, as in ferns, lycopods, and equiseta, and
cellular acrogens, or bryophyta, having the sexual plant most
conspicuous, but destitute of vascular tissue, as in mosses and scale
mosses. 2. thallogens.  plants without distinct stem and leaves,
consisting of a simple or branched mass of cellular tissue, or educed
to a single cell. reproduction effected variously. divided into alg,
which contain chlorophyll or its equivalent, and which live upon air
and water, and fungi, which contain no chlorophyll, and live on organic
matter. (lichens are now believed to be fungi parasitic on included
alg.}

many botanists divide the phnogamia primarily into gymnosperms and
angiosperms, and the latter into dicotyledons and monocotyledons.
others consider pteridophyta and bryophyta to be separate classes.
thallogens are variously divided by different writers, and the places
for diatoms, slime molds, and stoneworts are altogether uncertain.

2. a plant used or cultivated for food for man or domestic animals, as
the cabbage, turnip, potato, bean, dandelion, etc.; also, the edible
part of such a plant, as prepared for market or the table.

vegetables and fruits are sometimes loosely distinguished by the usual
need of cooking the former for the use of man, while the latter may be
eaten raw; but the distinction often fails, as in the case of quinces,
barberries, and other fruits, and lettuce, celery, and other
vegetables. tomatoes if cooked are vegetables, if eaten raw are fruits.

on the roadway, but commonly now by the action of the feet on a pedal

ve*loc"i*pe`dist (?), n. one who rides on a velocipede.

ve*loc"i*ty (?), n.; pl. velocities (#). [l. velocitas, from velox,
-ocis, swift, quick; perhaps akin to v&?;lare to fly (see volatile):
cf. f. velocite.]

1. quickness of motion; swiftness; speed; celerity; rapidity; as, the
velocity of wind; the velocity of a planet or comet in its orbit or
course; the velocity of a cannon ball; the velocity of light.

in such phrases, velocity is more generally used than celerity. we
apply celerity to animals; as, a horse or an ostrich runs with
celerity; but bodies moving in the air or in ethereal space move with
greater or less velocity, not celerity. this usage is arbitrary, and
perhaps not universal.

2. (mech.) rate of motion; the relation of motion to time, measured by
the number of units of space passed over by a moving body or point in a
unit of time, usually the number of feet passed over in a second. see
the note under speed.

angular velocity. see under angular. - - initial velocity, the velocity
of a moving body at starting; especially, the velocity of a projectile
as it leaves the mouth of a firearm from which it is discharged. 
relative velocity, the velocity with which a body approaches or recedes
from another body, whether both are moving or only one.  uniform
velocity, velocity in which the same number of units of space are
described in each successive unit of time.  variable velocity,
velocity in which the space described varies from instant, either
increasing or decreasing;  in the former case called accelerated
velocity, in the latter, retarded velocity; the acceleration or
retardation itself being also either uniform or variable.  virtual
velocity. see under virtual.

in variable velocity, the velocity, strictly, at any given instant, is
the rate of motion at that instant, and is expressed by the units of
space, which, if the velocity at that instant were continued uniform
during a unit of time, would be described in the unit of time; thus,
the velocity of a falling body at a given instant is the number of feet
which, if the motion which the body has at that instant were continued
uniformly for one second, it would pass through in the second. the
scientific sense of velocity differs from the popular sense in being
applied to all rates of motion, however slow, while the latter implies
more or less rapidity or quickness of motion.

syn.  swiftness; celerity; rapidity; fleetness; speed.

||ver"te*bra (?), n.; pl. vertebr (#). [l. vertebra, fr. vertere to

||
1. (anat.) one of the serial segments of the spinal column.

in many fishes the vertebr are simple cartilaginous disks or short
cylinders, but in the higher vertebrates they are composed of many
parts, and the vertebr in different portions of the same column vary
very greatly. a well-developed vertebra usually consists of a more or
less cylindrical and solid body, or centrum, which is surmounted
dorsally by an arch, leaving an opening which forms a part of the canal
containing the spinal cord. from this dorsal, or neural, arch spring
various processes, or apophyses, which have received special names: a
dorsal, or neural, spine, spinous process, or neurapophysis, on the
middle of the arch; two anterior and two posterior articular processes,
or zygapophyses; and one or two transverse processes on each side. in
those vertebr which bear well-developed ribs, a tubercle near the end
of the rib articulates at a tubercular facet on the transverse process
(diapophysis), while the end, or head, of the rib articulates at a more
ventral capitular facet which is sometimes developed into a second, or
ventral, transverse process (parapophysis). in vertebrates with
well-developed hind limbs, the spinal column is divided into five
regions in each of which the vertebr are specially designated: those
vertebr in front of, or anterior to, the first vertebra which bears
ribs connected with the sternum are cervical; all those which bear ribs
and are back of the cervicals are dorsal; the one or more directly
supporting the pelvis are sacral and form the sacrum; those between the
sacral and dorsal are lumbar; and all those back of the sacral are
caudal, or coccygeal. in man there are seven cervical vertebr, twelve
dorsal, five lumbar, five sacral, and usually four, but sometimes five
and rarely three, coccygeal.

2. (phon.) sound of the kind or quality heard in speech or song in the
consonants b, v, d, etc., and in the vowels; sonant, or intonated,
utterance; tone;  distinguished from mere breath sound as heard in f,
s, sh, etc., and also whisper.

voice, in this sense, is produced by vibration of the so-called vocal
cords in the larynx (see illust. of larynx) which act upon the air, not
in the manner of the strings of a stringed instrument, but as a pair of
membranous tongues, or reeds, which, being continually forced apart by
the outgoing current of breath, and continually brought together again
by their own elasticity and muscular tension, break the breath current
into a series of puffs, or pulses, sufficiently rapid to cause the
sensation of tone. the power, or loudness, of such a tone depends on
the force of the separate pulses, and this is determined by the
pressure of the expired air, together with the resistance on the part
of the vocal cords which is continually overcome. its pitch depends on
the number of aerial pulses within a given time, that is, on the
rapidity of their succession. see guide to pronunciation,  5, 146,
155.

1. the power of choosing; the faculty or endowment of the soul by which
it is capable of choosing; the faculty or power of the mind by which we
decide to do or not to do; the power or faculty of preferring or
selecting one of two or more objects.

it is necessary to form a distinct notion of what is meant by the word
"volition" in order to understand the import of the word will, for this
last word expresses the power of mind of which "volition" is the act.

stewart.

will is an ambiguous word, being sometimes put for the faculty of
willing; sometimes for the act of that faculty, besides [having] other
meanings. but "volition" always signifies the act of willing, and
nothing else.

reid.

appetite is the will's solicitor, and the will is appetite's
controller; what we covet according to the one, by the other we often

j. edwards.

2. the choice which is made; a determination or preference which
results from the act or exercise of the power of choice; a volition.

the word "will," however, is not always used in this its proper
acceptation, but is frequently substituted for "volition", as when i
say that my hand mover in obedience to my will.

stewart.

3. the choice or determination of one who has authority; a decree; a
command; discretionary pleasure.

thy will be done.

matt. vi. 10.

our prayers should be according to the will of god.

law.

4. strong wish or inclination; desire; purpose.

"inclination is another word with which will is frequently confounded.
thus, when the apothecary says, in romeo and juliet, 

my poverty, but not my will, consents; . . . put this in any liquid
thing you will, and drink it off.

the word will is plainly used as, synonymous with inclination; not in
the strict logical sense, as the immediate antecedent of action. it is
with the same latitude that the word is used in common conversation,
when we speak of doing a thing which duty prescribes, against one's own
will; or when we speak of doing a thing willingly or unwillingly."
stewart.

5. that which is strongly wished or desired.

what's your will, good friar?

shak.

the mariner hath his will.

6. arbitrary disposal; power to control, dispose, or determine.

7. (law) the legal declaration of a person's mind as to the manner in
which he would have his property or estate disposed of after his death;
the written instrument, legally executed, by which a man makes
disposition of his estate, to take effect after his death; testament;
devise. see the note under testament, 1.

wills are written or nuncupative, that is, oral. see nuncupative will,
under nuncupative.

at will (law), at pleasure. to hold an estate at the will of another,
is to enjoy the possession at his pleasure, and be liable to be ousted
at any time by the lessor or proprietor. an estate at will is at the
will of both parties. - - good will. see under good.  ill will,
enmity; unfriendliness; malevolence. - - to have one's will, to obtain
what is desired; to do what one pleases.  will worship, worship
according to the dictates of the will or fancy; formal worship. [obs.]
 will worshiper, one who offers will worship. [obs.] jer. taylor. 
with a will, with willingness and zeal; with all one's heart or
strength; earnestly; heartily.

will (?), v. t. & auxiliary. [imp. would (?). indic. present, i will
(obs. i wol), thou wilt, he will (obs. he wol); we, ye, they will.]
[oe. willen, imp. wolde; akin to os. willan, ofries. willa, d. willen,
g. wollen, ohg. wollan, wellan, icel. & sw. vilja, dan. ville, goth.
wiljan, oslav. voliti, l. velle to wish, volo i wish; cf. skr. v to
choose, to prefer. cf. voluntary, welcome, well, adv.]

1. to wish; to desire; to incline to have.

a wife as of herself no thing ne sholde [should] wille in effect, but
as her husband wolde [would].

chaucer.

caleb said unto her, what will thou ?

judg. i. 14.

they would none of my counsel.

prov. i. 30.

2. as an auxiliary, will is used to denote futurity dependent on the
verb. thus, in first person, "i will" denotes willingness, consent,
promise; and when "will" is emphasized, it denotes determination or
fixed purpose; as, i will go if you wish; i will go at all hazards. in
the second and third persons, the idea of distinct volition, wish, or
purpose is evanescent, and simple certainty is appropriately expressed;
as, "you will go," or "he will go," describes a future event as a fact
only. to emphasize will denotes (according to the tone or context)
certain futurity or fixed determination.

will, auxiliary, may be used elliptically for will go. "i'll to her
lodgings." marlowe.

as in shall (which see), the second and third persons may be virtually
converted into the first, either by question or indirect statement, so
as to receive the meaning which belongs to will in that person; thus,
"will you go?" (answer, "i will go") asks assent, requests, etc.; while
"will he go?" simply inquires concerning futurity; thus, also,"he says
or thinks he will go," "you say or think you will go," both signify
willingness or consent.

would, as the preterit of will, is chiefly employed in conditional,
subjunctive, or optative senses; as, he would go if he could; he could
go if he would; he said that he would go; i would fain go, but can not;
i would that i were young again; and other like phrases. in the last
use, the first personal pronoun is often omitted; as, would that he
were here; would to heaven that it were so; and, omitting the to in
such an adjuration. "would god i had died for thee." would is used for
both present and future time, in conditional propositions, and would
have for past time; as, he would go now if he were ready; if it should
rain, he would not go; he would have gone, had he been able. would not,
as also will not, signifies refusal. "he was angry, and would not go
in." luke xv. 28. would is never a past participle.

in ireland, scotland, and the united states, especially in the southern
and western portions of the united states, shall and will, should and
would, are often misused, as in the following examples: 

i am able to devote as much time and attention to other subjects as i
will [shall] be under the necessity of doing next winter.

chalmers.

a countryman, telling us what he had seen, remarked that if the
conflagration went on, as it was doing, we would [should] have, as our
next season's employment, the old town of edinburgh to rebuild.

h. miller.

i feel assured that i will [shall] not have the misfortune to find
conflicting views held by one so enlightened as your excellency.

j. y. mason.

<! p. 1654 !>

will (?), v. i. to be willing; to be inclined or disposed; to be
pleased; to wish; to desire.

and behold, there came a leper and worshiped him, saying, lord if thou
wilt, thou canst make me clean. and jesus . . . touched him, saying, i
will; be thou clean.

matt. viii. 2, 3.

this word has been confused with will, v. i., to choose, which, unlike
this, is of the weak conjugation.

will i, nill i, or will ye, hill ye, or will he, nill he, whether i,
you, or he will it or not; hence, without choice; compulsorily; 
sometimes corrupted into willy nilly. "if i must take service willy
nilly." j. h. newman. "land for all who would till it, and reading and
writing will ye, nill ye." lowell.

will, v. t. [imp. & p. p. willed (?); p. pr. & vb. n. willing. indic.

syn.  prudence; knowledge. wisdom, prudence, knowledge. wisdom has
been defined to be "the use of the best means for attaining the best
ends." "we conceive," says whewell, " prudence as the virtue by which
we select right means for given ends, while wisdom implies the
selection of right ends as well as of right means." hence, wisdom
implies the union of high mental and moral excellence. prudence (that
is, providence, or forecast) is of a more negative character; it rather
consists in avoiding danger than in taking decisive measures for the
accomplishment of an object. sir robert walpole was in many respects a
prudent statesman, but he was far from being a wise one. burke has said
that prudence, when carried too far, degenerates into a "reptile
virtue," which is the more dangerous for its plausible appearance.
knowledge, a more comprehensive term, signifies the simple apprehension
of facts or relations. "in strictness of language," says paley, " there
is a difference between knowledge and wisdom; wisdom always supposing
action, and action directed by it."

knowledge and wisdom, far from being one, have ofttimes no connection.
knowledge dwells in heads replete with thoughts of other men; wisdom,
in minds attentive to their own. knowledge, a rude, unprofitable mass,
the mere materials with which wisdom builds, till smoothed, and
squared, and fitted to its place, does but encumber whom it seems to
enrich. knowledge is proud that he has learned so much; wisdom is
humble that he knows no more.

syn.  ingenuity; humor; satire; sarcasm; irony; burlesque.  wit,
humor. wit primarily meant mind; and now denotes the power of seizing
on some thought or occurrence, and, by a sudden turn, presenting it
under aspects wholly new and unexpected  apparently natural and
admissible, if not perfectly just, and bearing on the subject, or the
parties concerned, with a laughable keenness and force. "what i want,"
said a pompous orator, aiming at his antagonist, "is common sense."
"exactly!" was the whispered reply. the pleasure we find in wit arises
from the ingenuity of the turn, the sudden surprise it brings, and the
patness of its application to the case, in the new and ludicrous
relations thus flashed upon the view. humor is a quality more congenial
to the english mind than wit. it consists primarily in taking up the
peculiarities of a humorist (or eccentric person) and drawing them out,
as addison did those of sir roger de coverley, so that we enjoy a
hearty, good-natured laugh at his unconscious manifestation of whims
and oddities. from this original sense the term has been widened to
embrace other sources of kindly mirth of the same general character. in
a well-known caricature of english reserve, an oxford student is
represented as standing on the brink of a river, greatly agitated at
the sight of a drowning man before him, and crying out, "o that i had
been introduced to this gentleman, that i might save his life! the,
"silent woman" of ben jonson is one of the most humorous productions,
in the original sense of the term, which we have in our language.

walker condemns the pronunciation woond as a "capricious novelty." it
is certainly opposed to an important principle of our language, namely,
that the old english long sound written ou, and pronounced like french
ou or modern english oo, has regularly changed, when accented, into the
diphthongal sound usually written with the same letters ou in modern
english, as in ground, hound, round, sound. the use of ou in old
english to represent the sound of modern english oo was borrowed from
the french, and replaced the older and anglo-saxon spelling with u. it
makes no difference whether the word was taken from the french or not,
provided it is old enough in english to have suffered this change to
what is now the common sound of ou; but words taken from the french at
a later time, or influenced by french, may have the french sound.

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future
generations. to learn more about the project gutenberg literary

section 4. information about donations to the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation

project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states. compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. to send
donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states. u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. to
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

section 5. general information about project gutenberg-tm electronic works.

professor michael s. hart was the originator of the project
gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. for forty years, he produced and
distributed project gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the u.s. unless a copyright notice is included. thus, we do not
necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

most people start at our web site which has the main pg search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

this web site includes information about project gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation, how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks.
