      [enter _juan de castro_, and _michael perez_.]

michael perez:

      are your companies full, colonel?

juan de castro:

      no, not yet, sir:
      nor will not be this month yet, as i reckon;
      how rises your command?

michael perez:

      we pick up still, and as our monies hold out,
      we have men come, about that time i think
      we shall be full too, many young gallants go.

juan de castro:

      and unexperienced,
      the wars are dainty dreams to young hot spirits,
      time and experience will allay those visions,
      we have strange things to fill our numbers,
      there's one _don leon_, a strange goodly fellow,
      recommended to me from some noble friends,
      for my _alferes_, had you but seen his person,
      and what a giants promise it protesteth.

michael perez:

      i have heard of him, and that he hath serv'd before too.

juan de castro:

      but no harm done, nor never meant, _don michael_,
      that came to my ears yet, ask him a question,
      he blushes like a girl, and answers little,
      to the point less, he wears a sword, a good one,
      and good cloaths too, he is whole skin'd, has no hurt yet,
      good promising hopes, i never yet heard certainly
      of any gentleman that saw him angry.

michael perez:

      preserve him, he'll conclude a peace if need be,
      many as strong as he will go along with us,
      that swear as valiantly as heart can wish,
      their mouths charg'd with six oaths at once, and whole ones,
      that make the drunken dutch creep into mole-hills.

juan de castro:

      'tis true, such we must look for: but _mich. perez_,
      when heard you of _donna margarita_, the great heiress?

michael perez:

      i hear every hour of her, though i never saw her,
      she is the main discourse: noble _don juan de castro_,
      how happy were that man could catch this wench up,
      and live at ease! she is fair, and young, and wealthy,
      infinite wealthy, and as gracious too
      in all her entertainments, as men report.

juan de castro:

      but she is proud, sir, that i know for certain,
      and that comes seldome without wantonness,
      he that shall marry her, must have a rare hand.

michael perez:

      would i were married, i would find that wisdom,
      with a light rein to rule my wife: if ever woman
      of the most subtile mould went beyond me,
      i would give the boys leave to whoot me out o'th' parish.

      [enter a servant.]

servant:

      sir, there be two gentlewomen attend to speak
      with you.

juan de castro:

      wait on 'em in.

michael perez:

      are they two handsome women?

servant:

      they seem so, very handsom, but they are vail'd, sir.

michael perez:

      thou put'st sugar in my mouth, how it melts with me!
      i love a sweet young wench.

juan de castro:

      wait on them in i say.
                                                                [exit servant.

michael perez:

      _don juan._

juan de castro:

      how you itch, _michael_! how you burnish!
      will not this souldiers heat out of your bones yet,
      do your eyes glow now?

michael perez:

      there be two.

juan de castro:

      say honest, what shame have you then?

michael perez:

      i would fain see that,
      i have been in the indies twice, and have seen strange things,
      but two honest women;--one i read of once.

juan de castro:

      prithee be modest.

michael perez:

      i'll be any thing.

      [enter _servant_, _donna clara_, and _estifania_ vail'd.]

juan de castro:

      you are welcome ladies.

michael perez:

      both hooded, i like 'em well though,
172]  they come not for advice in law sure hither;
      may be they would learn to raise the pike,
      i am for 'em: they are very modest, 'tis a fine preludium.

juan de castro:

      with me, or with this gentleman,
      would you speak, lady?

clara:

      with you, sir, as i guess, _juan de castro_.

michael perez:

      her curtain opens, she is a pretty gentlewoman.

juan de castro:

      i am the man, and shall be bound to fortune,
      i may do any service to your beauties.

clara:

      captain, i hear you are marching down to _flanders_,
      to serve the catholick king.

juan de castro:

      i am sweet lady.

clara:

      i have a kinsman, and a noble friend,
      imploy'd in those wars, may be, sir, you know him,
      _don campusano_ captain of _carbines_,
      to whom i would request your nobleness,
      to give this poor remembrance.

                                                                    [a letter.

juan de castro:

      i shall do it,
      i know the gentleman, a most worthy captain.

clara:

      something in private.

juan de castro:

      step aside: i'll serve thee.
                                                     [ex. _juan_, and _clara_.

michael perez:

      prithee let me see thy face.

estifania:

      sir, you must pardon me,
      women of our sort, that maintain fair memories,
      and keep suspect off from their chastities,
      had need wear thicker vails.

michael perez:

      i am no blaster of a ladies beauty,
      nor bold intruder on her special favours,
      i know how tender reputation is,
      and with what guards it ought to be preserv'd, lady,
      you may to me.

estifania:

      you must excuse me, seignior, i come
      not here to sell my self.

michael perez:

      as i am a gentleman, by the honour of a souldier.

estifania:

      i believe you,
      i pray you be civil, i believe you would see me,
      and when you have seen me i believe you will like me,
      but in a strange place, to a stranger too,
      as if i came on purpose to betray you,
      indeed i will not.
173]

michael perez:

      i shall love you dearly,
      and 'tis a sin to fling away affection,
      i have no mistress, no desire to honour
      any but you, will not this oyster open?
      i know not, you have struck me with your modesty;
      she will draw sure; so deep, and taken from me
      all the desire i might bestow on others,
      quickly before they come.

estifania:

      indeed i dare not:
      but since i see you are so desirous, sir,
      to view a poor face that can merit nothing
      but your repentance.

michael perez:

      it must needs be excellent.

estifania:

      and with what honesty you ask it of me,
      when i am gone let your man follow me,
      and view what house i enter, thither come,
      for there i dare be bold to appear open:
      and as i like your vertuous carriage then,

      [enter _juan_, _clara_, a servant.]

      i shall be able to give welcome to you;
      she hath done her business, i must take my leave, sir.

michael perez:

      i'll kiss your fair white hand and thank you, lady.
      my man shall wait, and i shall be your servant;
      sirrah, come near, hark.

servant:

      i shall do it faithfully.
                                                                        [exit.

juan de castro:

      you will command me no more services?

clara:

      to be careful of your noble health, dear sir,
      that i may ever honour you.

juan de castro:

      i thank you,
      and kiss your hands, wait on the ladies down there.

                                                 [exeunt ladies, and servants.

michael perez:

      you had the honour to see the face that came to you?

juan de castro:

      and 'twas a fair one; what was yours, _don michael_?

michael perez:

      mine was i'th' clipse, and had a cloud drawn over it.
      but i believe well, and i hope 'tis handsome,
      she had a hand would stir a holy hermite.

juan de castro:

      you know none of 'em?

michael perez:

      no.

juan de castro:

      then i do, captain,
174]  but i'll say nothing till i see the proof on't,
      sit close _don perez_, or your worship's caught.
      i fear a flye.

michael perez:

      were those she brought love-letters?

juan de castro:

      a packet to a kinsman now in _flanders_,
      yours was very modest methought.

michael perez:

      some young unmanag'd thing,
      but i may live to see--

juan de castro:

      'tis worth experience,
      let's walk abroad and view our companies.

                                                                      [exeunt.

      [enter _sanchio_, and _alonzo_.]

sanchio:

      what, are you for the wars, _alonzo_?

alonzo:

      it may be i,
      it may be no, e'n as the humour takes me.
      if i find peace amongst the female creatures,
      and easie entertainment, i'll stay at home,
      i am not so far obliged yet to long marches
      and mouldy biskets, to run mad for honour,
      when you are all gone i have my choice before me.

sanchio:

      of which hospital thou wilt sweat in; wilt thou
      never leave whoring?

alonzo:

      there is less danger in't than gunning, _sanchio_,
      though we be shot sometimes, the shot's not mortal,
      besides, it breaks no limbs.

sanchio:

      but it disables 'em,
      dost thou see how thou pull'st thy legs after thee, as they
      hung by points.

alonzo:

      better to pull 'em thus than walk on wooden ones,
      serve bravely for a billet to support me.

sanchio:

      fye, fye, 'tis base.

alonzo:

      dost thou count it base to suffer?
      suffer abundantly? 'tis the crown of honour;
      you think it nothing to lie twenty days
      under a surgeons hands that has no mercy.

sanchio:

      as thou hast done i am sure, but i perceive now
      why you desire to stay, the orient heiress,
      the _margarita_, sir,

alonzo:

      i would i had her.

sanchio:

      they say she will marry.
175]

alonzo:

      i think she will.

sanchio:

      and marry suddenly, as report goes too,
      she fears her youth will not hold out, _alonzo_.

alonzo:

      i would i had the sheathing on't.

sanchio:

      they say too
      she has a greedy eye that must be fed
      with more than one mans meat.

alonzo:

      would she were mine,
      i would cater for her well enough; but _sanchio_,
      there be too many great men that adore her,
      princes, and princes fellows, that claim priviledge.

sanchio:

      yet those stand off i'th' way of marriage,
      to be tyed to a man's pleasure is a second labour.

alonzo:

      she has bought a brave house here in town.

sanchio:

      i have heard so.

alonzo:

      if she convert it now to pious uses,
      and bid poor gentlemen welcome.

sanchio:

      when comes she to it?

alonzo:

      within these two days, she is in the country yet,
      and keeps the noblest house.

sanchio:

      then there's some hope of her,
      wilt thou go my way?

alonzo:

      no, no, i must leave you,
      and repair to an old gentlewoman
      that has credit with her, that can speak a good word.

sanchio:

      send thee good fortune, but make thy body sound first.

alonzo:

      i am a souldier,
      and too sound a body becomes me not;
      farewel, _sanchio_.

                                                                      [exeunt.

      and hereabouts i lost her; stay, that's she,
      'tis very she,--she makes me a low court'sie,

      how happy should i be if she love my master:

      and eat abundantly: i thank my fortune,
      i'll back with speed, and bring him happy tidings.

      we are sent for?

      she would break to us in private.

3 lady:

      it should seem so.
      'tis a good lady, and a wise young lady.

2 lady:

      and vertuous enough too i warrant ye
      for a young woman of her years; 'tis pity
      to load her tender age with too much vertue.

      she does well and wisely,
      to ask the counsel of the ancientst, madam,

      i see he is hasty, and i would give him leave

michael perez:

      you have made me now too bountifull amends, lady
      for your strict carriage when you saw me first,
      these beauties were not meant to be conceal'd,
      it was a wrong to hide so sweet an object,
      i cou'd now chide ye, but it shall be thus,
      no other anger ever touch your sweetness.

estifania:

      you appear to me so honest, and so civil,
      without a blush sir, i dare bid ye welcom.

michael perez:

      now let me ask your name.

estifania:

      'tis _estifanie_, the heir of this poor place.

michael perez:

      poor do you call it?
      there's nothing that i cast mine eyes upon,
      but shews both rich and admirable, all the rooms
      are hung as if a princess were to dwell here,
      the gardens, orchards, every thing so curious:
      is all that plate your own too?

estifania:

      'tis but little,
      only for present use, i have more and richer,
      when need shall call, or friends compel me use it,
      the sutes you see of all the upper chamber,
      are those that commonly adorn the house,
      i think i have besides, as fair, as civil,
      as any town in _spain_ can parallel.

michael perez:

      now if she be not married, i have some hopes.
      are you a maid?

estifania:

      you make me blush to answer,
      i ever was accounted so to this hour,
      and that's the reason that i live retir'd sir.

michael perez:

      then would i counsel you to marry presently,
180]  (if i can get her, i am made for ever)
      for every year you lose, you lose a beauty,
      a husband now, an honest careful husband,
      were such a comfort: will ye walk above stairs?

estifania:

      this place will fit our talk, 'tis fitter far sir,
      above there are day-beds, and such temptations
      i dare not trust sir.

michael perez:

      she is excellent wise withal too.

estifania:

      you nam'd a husband, i am not so strict sir,
      nor ti'd unto a virgins solitariness,
      but if an honest, and a noble one,
      rich, and a souldier, for so i have vowed he shall be,
      were offer'd me, i think i should accept him,
      but above all he must love.

michael perez:

      he were base else,
      there's comfort ministred in the word souldier,
      how sweetly should i live!

estifania:

      i am not so ignorant, but that i know well,
      how to be commanded,
      and how again to make my self obey'd sir,
      i waste but little, i have gather'd much,
      my rial not the less worth, when 'tis spent,
      if spent by my direction, to please my husband,
      i hold it as indifferent in my duty,
      to be his maid i'th' kitchen, or his cook,
      as in the hall to know my self the mistris.

michael perez:

      sweet, rich, and provident, now fortune stick
      to me; i am a souldier, and a bachelour, lady,
      and such a wife as you, i cou'd love infinitely,
      they that use many words, some are deceitfull,
      i long to be a husband, and a good one,
      for 'tis most certain i shall make a president
      for all that follow me to love their ladies,
      i am young you see, able i would have you think too,
      if't please you know, try me before you take me.
      'tis true i shall not meet in equal wealth
      with ye, but jewels, chains, such as the war
      has given me, a thousand duckets i dare
      presume on in ready gold, now as your
      care may handle it, as rich cloths too, as
181]  any he bears arms lady.

estifania:

      you are a true gentleman, and fair, i see by ye,
      and such a man i had rather take.

michael perez:

      pray do so, i'le have a priest o'th' sudden.

estifania:

      and as suddenly you will repent too.

michael perez:

      i'le be hang'd or drown'd first,
      by this and this, and this kiss.

estifania:

      you are a flatterer,
      but i must say there was something when i saw you
      first, in that most noble face, that stirr'd my fancy.

michael perez:

      i'le stir it better e're you sleep sweet lady,
      i'le send for all my trunks and give up all to ye,
      into your own dispose, before i bed ye,
      and then sweet wench.

margarita:

      sit down and give me your opinions seriously.

1 lady:

      you say you have a mind to marry lady.

margarita:

      'tis true, i have for to preserve my credit,
      yet not so much for that as for my state ladies,
      conceive me right, there lies the main o'th' question,
      credit i can redeem, mony will imp it,
      but when my monie's gone, when the law shall
      seize that, and for incontinency strip me
      of all.

1 lady:

      do you find your body so malitious that way?

margarita:

      i find it as all bodies are that are young and lusty,
      lazy, and high fed, i desire my pleasure,
      and pleasure i must have.

2 lady:

      'tis fit you should have,
      your years require it, and 'tis necessary,
      as necessary as meat to a young lady,
      sleep cannot nourish more.

1 lady:

      but might not all this be, and keep ye single.
      you take away variety in marriage,
      the abundance of the pleasure you are bar'd then,
182]  is't not abundance that you aim at?

margarita:

      yes why was i made a woman?

2 lady:

      and every day a new?

margarita:

      why fair and young but to use it?

1 lady:

      you are still i'th' right, why would you marry then?

altea:

      because a husband stops all doubts in this point,
      and clears all passages.

2 lady:

      what husband mean ye?

altea:

      a husband of an easy faith, a fool,
      made by her wealth, and moulded to her pleasure,
      one though he see himself become a monster,
      shall hold the door, and entertain the maker.

2 lady:

      you grant there may be such a man.

1 lady:

      yes marry, but how to bring 'em to this rare perfection.

2 lady:

      they must be chosen so, things of no honour,
      nor outward honesty.

margarita:

      no 'tis no matter,
      i care not what they are, so they be lusty.

2 lady:

      me thinks now a rich lawyer, some such fellow,
      that carries credit, and a face of awe,
      but lies with nothing but his clients business.

margarita:

      no there's no trusting them, they are too subtil,
      the law has moulded 'em of natural mischief.

1 lady:

      then some grave governor,
      some man of honour, yet an easy man.

margarita:

      if he have honour i am undone, i'le none such,
      i'le have a lusty man, honour will cloy me..br

altea:

      'tis fit ye should lady;
      and to that end, with search and wit and labour,
      i have found one out, a right one and a perfect,
      he is made as strong as brass, is of brave years too,
      and doughty of complexion.

margarita:

      is he a gentleman?

altea:

      yes and a souldier, as gentle as you would wish him,
      a good fellow, wears good cloaths.

margarita:

      those i'le allow him,
      they are for my credit, does he understand
      but little?

altea:

      very little.

margarita:

      'tis the better,
      have not the wars bred him up to anger?

      no, he will not quarrel with a dog that bites hi[m],
      let him be drunk or sober, is one silence.

margarita:

      h'as no capacity what honor is?
      for that's the souldiers god.

altea:

      honour's a thing too subtil for his wisdom,
      if honour lye in eating, he is right honourable.

margarita:

      is he so goodly a man do you say?

altea:

      as you shall see lady,
      but to all this is but a trunk.

margarita:

      i would have him so,
      i shall adde branches to him to adorn him,
      goe, find me out this man, and let me see him,
      if he be that motion that you tell me of,
      and make no more noise, i shall entertain him,
      let him be here.

      you are welcom to it sir.

michael perez:

      i think i have the sweetest seat in _spain_ wench,
      me thinks the richest too, we'l eat i'th' garden
      in one o'th' arbours, there 'tis cool and pleasant,
      and have our wine cold in the running fountain.
      who's that?

estifania:

      a friend of mine sir.

michael perez:

      of what breeding?

estifania:

      a gentlewoman sir.

michael perez:

      what business has she?
      is she a learned woman i'th' mathematicks,
      can she tell fortunes?

estifania:

      more than i know sir.

michael perez:

      or has she e're a letter from a kinswoman,
      that must be delivered in my absence wife,
      or comes she from the doctor to salute ye,
      and learn your health? she looks not like a confessor.

estifania:

      what need all this, why are you troubled sir?
      what do you suspect, she cannot cuckold ye,
      she is a woman sir, a very woman.

michael perez:

      your very woman may do very well sir
      toward the matter, for though she cannot perform it
189]  in her own person, she may do it by proxie,
      your rarest jugglers work still by conspiracy.

estifania:

      cry ye mercy husband, you are jealous then,
      and happily suspect me.

michael perez:

      no indeed wife.

estifania:

      me thinks you should not till you have more cause
      and clearer too: i am sure you have heard say husband,
      a woman forced will free her self through iron,
      a happy, calm, and good wife discontented
      may be taught tricks.

michael perez:

      no, no, i do but jest with ye.

estifania:

      why, what's four daies? had you a sister sir,
      a niece or mistris that required this courtesie,
      and should i make a scruple to do you good?

      if easily it would come back.

estifania:

      i swear sir,
      as easily as it came on, is't not pity
      to let such a gentlewoman for a little help--
      you give away no house.

      now you have got a shadow, an _umbrella_

      from your fair credit.

margarita:

      i am at peace _altea_,

      he outwardly professes, i am happy,
      the pleasure i shall live in and the freedom
      without the squint-eye of the law upon me,
      or prating liberty of tongues, that envy.

altea:

      you are a made woman.

      i was brought up a courtier, high and happy,
      and company is my delight, and courtship,

      but what are husbands? read the new worlds wonders,
      such husbands as this monstrous world produces,
      and you will scarce find such deformities,
      they are shadows to conceal your venial vertues,
      sails to your mills, that grind with all occasions,

      the piece of ignorant dow, he stood up to me
      and mated my commands, this was your providence,
      your wisdom, to elect this gentleman,
      your excellent forecast in the man, your knowledge,
      what think ye now?

altea:

      i think him an asse still,
      this boldness some of your people have blown
      into him, this wisdom too with strong wine,
      'tis a tyrant, and a philosopher also, and finds
      out reasons.

margarita:

      i'le have my celler lockt, no school kept there,
      nor no discovery. i'le turn my drunkards,
      such as are understanding in their draughts,

      to grass immediatly, i'le keep all fools,
      sober or drunk, still fools, that shall know nothing,

      for they are not able to maintain a cat here,
      and those appear as fearfull as two devils,
      they have eat a map of the whole world up already,
      and if we stay a night we are gone for company.
      there's an old woman that's now grown to marble,
      dri'd in this brick hill, and she sits i'th' chimnie,
      which is but three tiles rais'd like a house of cards,
      the true proportion of an old smok'd sibyl,
      there is a young thing too that nature meant
      for a maid-servant, but 'tis now a monster,
      she has a husk about her like a chesnut
      with basiness, and living under the line here,

      and has provided too, she sent me word sir,
      and will give over gratefully unto you.

michael perez:

      i'le walk i'th' church-yard,
      the dead cannot offend more than these living,
      an hour hence i'le expect ye.

      i'le not fail sir.

michael perez:

      and do you hear, let's have a handsom dinner,
      and see all things be decent as they have been,
      and let me have a strong bath to restore me,
      i stink like a stal-fish shambles, or an oyl-shop.

estifania:

      you shall have all, which some interpret nothing,
      i'le send ye people for the trunks afore-hand,
      and for the stuff.

michael perez:

      let 'em be known and honest,
      and do my service to your niece.

estifania:

      i shall sir,
      but if i come not at my hour, come thither,
      that they may give you thanks for your fair courtesy,
      and pray ye be brave for my sake.

michael perez:

sanchio:

      thou art very brave.

cacafogo:

      i have reason, i have mony.

sanchio:

      is mony reason?

cacafogo:

      yes and rime too captain,
      if ye have no mony y'are an asse.

sanchio:

      i thank ye.

cacafogo:

      ye have manners, ever thank him that has mony.

sanchio:

      wilt thou lend me any?

cacafogo:

      not a farthing captain,
      captains are casual things.

sanchio:

      why so are all men, thou shalt have my bond.

cacafogo:

      nor bonds nor fetters captain,
      my mony is mine, i make no doubt on't.

juan de castro:

      what dost thou do with it?

cacafogo:

      put it to pious uses,
      buy wine and wenches, and undo young coxcombs
      that would undo me.

juan de castro:

      are those hospitals?

cacafogo:

      i first provide to fill my hospitals
      with creatures of mine own, that i know wretched,
      and then i build: those are more bound to pray for me:
      besides, i keep th' inheritance in my name still.

juan de castro:

      a provident charity; are you for the wars, sir?

cacafogo:

      i am not poor enough to be a souldier,
      nor have i faith enough to ward a bullet;
      this is no lining for a trench, i take it.

juan de castro:

      ye have said wisely.

cacafogo:

      had you but my money,
      you would swear it colonel, i had rather drill at home
      a hundred thousand crowns, and with more honour,
      than exercise ten thousand fools with nothing,
      a wise man safely feeds, fools cut their fingers.

sanchio:

      a right state usurer; why dost thou not marry,
      and live a reverend justice?

cacafogo:

      is't not nobler to command a reverend justice, than to be one?
      and for a wife, what need i marry, captain,
      when every courteous fool that owes me money,
      owes me his wife too, to appease my fury?

juan de castro:

      wilt thou go to dinner with us?

cacafogo:

      i will go, and view the pearl of _spain_, the orient
      fair one, the rich one too, and i will be respected,
      i bear my patent here, i will talk to her,
      and when your captain's ships shall stand aloof,
      and pick your noses, i will pick the purse
      of her affection.

juan de castro:

      the duke dines there to day too, the duke of _medina_.

cacafogo:

      let the king dine there,
      he owes me money, and so far's my creature,
      and certainly i may make bold with mine own, captain?

sanchio:

      thou wilt eat monstrously.

cacafogo:

      like a true born _spaniard_,
      eat as i were in _england_ where the beef grows,
      and i will drink abundantly, and then
      talk ye as wantonly as _ovid_ did,
200]  to stir the intellectuals of the ladies;
      i learnt it of my father's amorous scrivener.

juan de castro:

      if we should play now, you must supply me.

cacafogo:

      you must pawn a horse troop,
      and then have at ye colonel.

sanchio:

      come, let's go:
      this rascal will make rare sport; how the ladies
      will laugh at him?

juan de castro:

      if i light on him i'll make his purse sweat too.

cacafogo:

      will ye lead, gentlemen?

      and my goods gone, what pick-lock spirit?

old woman:

      ha, what would ye have?

michael perez:

      my goods again, how came my trunks all open?

old woman:

      are your trunks open?

michael perez:

      yes, and cloaths gone,
      and chains, and jewels: how she smells like hung beef,
      the palsey, and picklocks, fye, how she belches,
      the spirit of garlick.

old woman:

      where's your gentlewoman?
      the young fair woman?

michael perez:

      what's that to my question?
      she is my wife, and gone about my business.

maid:

      is she your wife, sir?

michael perez:

      yes sir, is that wonder?
      is the name of wife unknown here?

old woman:

      is she truly, truly your wife?

michael perez:

      i think so, for i married her;
      it was no vision sure!

maid:

      she has the keys, sir.

michael perez:

      i know she has, but who has all my goods, spirit?

old woman:

      if you be married to that gentlewoman,
      you are a wretched man, she has twenty husbands.

maid:

      she tells you true.

old woman:

      and she has cozen'd all, sir.

michael perez:

      the devil she has! i had a fair house with her,
201]  that stands hard by, and furnisht royally.

old woman:

      you are cozen'd too, 'tis none of hers, good gentleman.

maid:

      the lady _margarita_, she was her servant,
      and kept the house, but going from her, sir,
      for some lewd tricks she plaid.

michael perez:

      plague o' the devil,
      am i i'th' full meridian of my wisedom
      cheated by a stale quean! what kind of lady
      is that that owes the house?

old woman:

      a young sweet lady.

michael perez:

      of a low stature?

old woman:

      she is indeed but little, but she is wondrous fair.

michael perez:

      i feel i am cozen'd;
      now i am sensible i am undone,
      this is the very woman sure, that cousin
      she told me would entreat but for four days,
      to make the house hers; i am entreated sweetly.

maid:

      when she went out this morning, that i saw, sir,
      she had two women at the door attending,
      and there she gave 'em things, and loaded 'em,
      but what they were--i heard your trunks to open,
      if they be yours?

michael perez:

      they were mine while they were laden,
      but now they have cast their calves, they are not worth
      owning: was she her mistress say you?

old woman:

      her own mistress, her very mistress, sir, and all you saw
      about and in that house was hers.

michael perez:

      no plate, no jewels, nor no hangings?

maid:

      not a farthing, she is poor, sir, a poor shifting thing.

michael perez:

      no money?

old woman:

      abominable poor, as poor as we are,
      money as rare to her unless she steal it,
      but for one civil gown her lady gave her,
      she may go bare, good gentlewoman.

michael perez:

      i am mad now,
      i think i am as poor as she, i am wide else,
      one civil sute i have left too, and that's all,
      and if she steal that she must fley me for it;
      where does she use?

old woman:

      you may find truth as soon,
202]  alas, a thousand conceal'd corners, sir, she lurks in.
      and here she gets a fleece, and there another,
      and lives in mists and smoaks where none can find her.

michael perez:

      is she a whore too?

old woman:

      little better, gentleman, i dare not say she is so sir, because
      she is yours, sir, these five years she has firkt
      a pretty living,
      until she came to serve; i fear he will knock my
      brains out for lying.

michael perez:

      she has serv'd me faithfully,
      a whore and thief? two excellent moral learnings
      in one she-saint, i hope to see her legend.
      have i been fear'd for my discoveries,
      and courted by all women to conceal 'em?
      have i so long studied the art of this sex,
      and read the warnings to young gentlemen?
      have i profest to tame the pride of ladies,
      and make 'em bear all tests, and am i trickt now?
      caught in mine own nooze? here's a royal left yet,
      there's for your lodging and your meat for this week.
      a silk worm lives at a more plentiful ordinary,
      and sleeps in a sweeter box: farewel great grandmother,

duke of medina:

      nay, sir, you shall not carry it
      so bravely off, you shall not wrong a lady
      in a high huffing strain, and think to bear it,
      we stand not by as bawds to your brave fury,
      to see a lady weep.

leon:

      they are tears of anger, i beseech ye note 'em, not worth pity,
      wrung from her rage, because her will prevails not,
      she would swound now if she could not cry,
      else they were excellent, and i should grieve too,
      but falling thus, they show nor sweet nor orient.
      put up my lord, this is oppression,
      and calls the sword of justice to relieve me,
      the law to lend her hand, the king to right me,
      all which shall understand how you provoke me,
      in mine own house to brave me, is this princely?
      then to my guard, and if i spare your grace,
      and do not make this place your monument,
      too rich a tomb for such a rude behaviour,
      i have a cause will kill a thousand of ye, mercy forsake me.

      his wife be fair and young, but most dishonest,
      most impudent, and have no feeling of it,
      no conscience to reclaim her from a monster,
      let her lye by him like a flattering ruine,
      and at one instant kill both name and honour,
      let him be lost, no eye to weep his end,
      nor find no earth that's base enough to bury him.
      now sir, fall on, i am ready to oppose ye.

      it is all true i find, a wild-fire take her.

juan de castro:

      is thy wife with child, _don michael_? thy excellent wife.
      art thou a man yet?

alonzo:

      when shall we come and visit thee?

sanchio:

      and eat some rare fruit? thou hast admirable orchards,
208]  you are so jealous now, pox o' your jealousie,
      how scurvily you look!

michael perez:

      prithee leave fooling,
      i am in no humour now to fool and prattle,
      did she ne'r play the wag with you?

margarita:

      yes many times, so often that i was asham'd to keep her,
      but i forgave her, sir, in hope she would mend still,
      and had not you o'th' instant married her,
      i had put her off.

michael perez:

      i thank ye, i am blest still,
      which way so e'r i turn i am a made man,
      miserably gull'd beyond recovery.

juan de castro:

      you'll stay and dine?

michael perez:

      certain i cannot, captain,
      hark in thine ear, i am the arrantst puppy,
      the miserablest ass, but i must leave ye,
      i am in haste, in haste, bless you, good madam,
      and you prove as good as my wife.

michael perez:

      my worthy wife,
      i have been looking of your modesty
      all the town over.
209]

estifania:

      my most noble husband,
      i am glad i have found ye, for in truth i am weary,
      weary and lame with looking out your lordship.

michael perez:

      i have been in bawdy houses.

estifania:

      i believe you, and very lately too.

michael perez:

      'pray you pardon me,
      to seek your ladyship, i have been in cellars,
      in private cellars, where the thirsty bawds
      hear your confessions; i have been at plays,
      to look you out amongst the youthful actors,
      at puppet shews, you are mistress of the motions,
      at gossippings i hearkned after you,
      but amongst those confusions of lewd tongues
      there's no distinguishing beyond a babel.
      i was amongst the nuns because you sing well,
      but they say yours are bawdy songs, they mourn for ye,
      and last i went to church to seek you out,
      'tis so long since you were there, they have forgot you.

estifania:

      you have had a pretty progress, i'll tell mine now:
      to look you out, i went to twenty taverns.

michael perez:

      and are you sober?

estifania:

      yes, i reel not yet, sir,
      where i saw twenty drunk, most of 'em souldiers,
      there i had great hope to find you disguis'd too.
      from hence to th' dicing-house, there i found
      quarrels needless, and senceless, swords and pots, and candlesticks,
      tables and stools, and all in one confusion,
      and no man knew his friend. i left this _chaos_,
      and to the chirurgions went, he will'd me stay,
      for says he learnedly, if he be tipled,
      twenty to one he whores, and then i hear of him,
      if he be mad, he quarrels, then he comes too.
      i sought ye where no safe thing would have ventur'd,
      amongst diseases, base and vile, vile women,
      for i remembred your old roman axiom,
      the more the danger, still the more the honour.
      last, to your confessor i came, who told me,
      you were too proud to pray, and here i have found ye.

michael perez:

      she bears up bravely, and the rogue is witty,
      but i shall dash it instantly to nothing.
210]  here leave we off our wanton languages,
      and now conclude we in a sharper tongue.

estifania:

      why am i cozen'd?
      why am i abused?

michael perez:

      thou most vile, base, abominable--

estifania:

estifania:

michael perez:

      do you echo me?

estifania:

      yes sir, and go before ye,
      and round about ye, why do you rail at me
      for that that was your own sin, your own knavery?

michael perez:

      and brave me too?

estifania:

      you had best now draw your sword, captain!
      draw it upon a woman, do, brave captain,
      upon your wife, oh most renowned captain.

michael perez:

      a plague upon thee, answer me directly;
      why didst thou marry me?

estifania:

      to be my husband;
      i had thought you had had infinite, but i'm cozen'd.

michael perez:

      why didst thou flatter me, and shew me wonders?
      a house and riches, when they are but shadows,
      shadows to me?

estifania:

      why did you work on me
      (it was but my part to requite you, sir)
      with your strong souldiers wit, and swore you would bring me
      so much in chains, so much in jewels, husband,
      so much in right rich cloaths?

michael perez:

      thou hast 'em, rascal;
      i gave 'em to thy hands, my trunks and all,
      and thou hast open'd 'em, and sold my treasure.

estifania:

      sir, there's your treasure, sell it to a tinker
      to mend old kettles, is this noble usage?
      let all the world view here the captain's treasure,
      a man would think now, these were worthy matters;
      here's a shooing-horn chain gilt over, how it scenteth
      worse than the mouldy durty heel it served for:
      and here's another of a lesser value,
      so little i would shame to tye my dog in't,
      these are my joynture, blush and save a labour,
211]  or these else will blush for ye.

michael perez:

      a fire subtle ye, are ye so crafty?

estifania:

      here's a goodly jewel,
      did not you win this at goletta, captain,
      or took it in the field from some brave _bashaw_
      how it sparkles like an old ladies eyes,
      and fills each room with light like a close lanthorn!
      this would do rarely in an abbey window,
      to cozen pilgrims.

michael perez:

      p[r]ithee leave prating.

estifania:

      and here's a chain of whitings eyes for pearls,
      a muscle-monger would have made a better.

michael perez:

      nay, prithee wife, my cloaths, my cloaths.

estifania:

      i'll tell ye,
      your cloaths are parallels to these, all counterfeit.
      put these and them on, you are a man of copper,
      a kind of candlestick; these you thought, my husband,
      to have cozen'd me withall, but i am quit with you.

michael perez:

      is there no house then, nor no grounds about it?
      no plate nor hangings?

estifania:

      there are none, sweet husband,
      shadow for shadow is as equal justice.
      can you rail now? pray put up your fury, sir,
      and speak great words, you are a souldier, thunder.

michael perez:

      i will speak little, i have plaid the fool,
      and so i am rewarded.

estifania:

      you have spoke well, sir,
      and now i see you are so conformable
      i'll heighten you again, go to your house,
      they are packing to be gone, you must sup there,
      i'll meet ye, and bring cloaths, and clean shirts after,
      and all things shall be well, i'll colt you once more,
      and teach you to bring copper.

michael perez:

      tell me one thing,
      i do beseech thee tell me, tell me truth, wife,
      however i forgive thee, art thou honest?
      the beldam swore.

estifania:

      i bid her tell you so, sir,
      it was my plot, alas my credulous husband,
      the lady told you too.

michael perez:

      most strange things of thee.

estifania:

      still 'twas my way, and all to try your sufferance,
      and she denied the house.

michael perez:

      she knew me not,
      no, nor no title that i had.

estifania:

      'twas well carried;
      no more, i am right and straight.

michael perez:

      i would believe thee,
      but heaven knows how my heart is, will ye follow me?

estifania:

      i'll be there straight.

      that people had compassion on it, looked so,
      the next sir palmerin, here's fine proportion,
      an ass, and then an elephant, sweet justice,
      there's no way left to come at her now, no craving,
      if money could come near, yet i would pay him;
      i have a mind to make him a huge cuckold,
      and money may do much, a thousand duckets,
      'tis but the letting blood of a rank heir.

      let it be so, i beseech thee, my sweet gentlewoman,
      do not forget thy self.

      this courtesie, because she knows you are noble.

      but we may both be cozen'd in that point sir.

margarita:

      you must provide a cradle, and what a troubles that?

leon:

      the sea shall rock it,
      'tis the best nurse; 'twill roar and rock together,
      a swinging storm will sing you such a lullaby.

duke of medina:

      what sir, preparing for your noble journey?
      'tis well, and full of care.
      i saw your mind was wedded to the war,
      and knew you would prove some good man for your country,
      therefore fair cousin with your gentle pardon,
      i got this place: what, mourn at his advancement?
      you are to blame, he will come again sweet cousin,
      mean time like sad _penelope_ and sage,
      amongst your maids at home, and huswifely.

leon:

      no sir, i dare not leave her to that solitariness,
      she is young, and grief or ill news from those quarters
      may daily cross her, she shall goe along sir.

      a sickly lady too?

      'twill make her well sir,
      there's no such friend to health as wholsom travel.

sanchio:

      away it must not be.

alonzo:

      it ought not sir,

duke of medina:

      i cannot blame her tears, fright her with tempests,
      with thunder of the war.
      i dare swear if she were able.

leon:

      she is most able.
      and pray ye swear not, she must goe, there's no remedy,
      nor greatness, nor the trick you had to part us,
      which i smell too rank, too open, too evident
      (and i must tell you sir, 'tis most unnoble)
      shall hinder me: had she but ten hours life,
      nay less, but two hours, i would have her with me,
      i would not leave her fame to so much ruine,
      to such a desolation and discredit
      as her weakness and your hot will wou'd work her to.

      i see you are packing now my gentle cousin,
      and my wife told me i should find it so,
      'tis true i do, you were merry when i was last here,
219]  but 'twas your will to try my patience madam.
      i am sorry that my swift occasions
      can let you take your pleasure here no longer,
      yet i would have you think my honour'd cousin,

      they are mine sir, and you know it,

      that are so busie in their offices,
      again to minister to their right uses,
      i shall take view o'th' plate anon, and furnitures
      that are of under place; you are merry still cousin,

      good evil wife leave fooling and tell me honestly,
      is this my kinsman?

      and all a dream we do? will ye walk out sir,
      and if i do not beat thee presently
      into a sound belief, as sense can give thee,
      brick me into that wall there for a chimny piece,

      your grace here, and my couz, we are all souldiers,

duke of medina:

      are ye blank at this? then i must tell ye sir,
      ye have no command, now ye may goe at pleasure
      and ride your asse troop, 'twas a trick i us'd
      to try your jealousie upon entreatie,
      and saving of your wife.

leon:

      all this not moves me,
      nor stirs my gall, nor alters my affections,
      you have more furniture, more houses lady,

      they are too light to drown, they are cork and feathers;
      to burn too cold, they live like salamanders;
      under huge heaps of stones to bury her,

      you are hurt mortally,

      what starts you make? i would not kiss you wantonly,

margarita:

      and bless us both, for sure this is the devil,
      i plainly heard it now, he will come to fetch ye,
      a very spirit, for he spoke under ground,
      and spoke to you just as you would have snatcht me,
      you are a wicked man, and sure this haunts ye,

      cut to the brains, or run clean through the body,
      to get out quietly as you got in sir,
      i wish it like a friend that loves ye dearly,
      for if my husband take ye, and take ye thus a counterfeit,
      one that would clip his credit out of his honour,
      he must kill ye presently,
      there is no mercy nor an hour of pity,
      and for me to intreat in such an agony,
      would shew me little better than one guilty,

      and like a foolish thing you have made your self so,
      could not your own discretion tell ye sir,
      when i was married i was none of yours?

      and i now stand in a circle and secure,
      your spells nor power can never reach my body,
      mark me but this, and then sir be most miserable,
      'tis sacriledge to violate a wedlock,
      you rob two temples, make your self twice guilty,
      you ruine hers, and spot her noble husbands.

prologue.

      pleasure attend ye, and about ye sit
      the springs of mirth, fancy, delight and wit
      to stir you up, do not your looks let fall,
      nor to remembrance our late errors call,
      because this day w' are _spaniards_ all again,
      the story of our play, and our scene _spain_:
      the errors too, do not for this cause hate,
      now we present their wit and not their state.
      nor ladies be not angry if you see,
      a young fresh beauty, wanton and too free,
      seek to abuse her husband, still 'tis _spain_,
      no such gross errors in your kingdom raign,
      w' are _vesrals_ all, and though we blow the fire,
      we seldom make it flame up to desire,
      take no example neither to begin,
      for some by precedent delight to sin:
      nor blame the poet if he slip aside
      sometimes lasciviously if not too wide.
      but hold your fanns close, and then smile at ease,
      a cruel scene did never lady please.
      nor gentlemen, pray be not you displeased,
235]  though we present some men fool'd, some diseased,
      some drunk, some mad: we mean not you, you're free,
      we taxe no farther than our comedie,
      you are our friends, sit noble then and see.





epilogue.

      good night our worthy friends, and may you part
      each with as merry and as free a heart
      as you came hither; to those noble eyes
      that deign to smile on our poor faculties,
      and give a blessing to our labouring ends,
      as we hope many, to such fortune sends
      their own desires, wives fair as light as chast;
      to those that live by spight wives made in hast.

section 2. information about the mission of project gutenbergtm

project gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. it
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenbergtms
goals and ensuring that the project gutenbergtm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenbergtm and future
generations. to learn more about the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
sections 3 and 4 and the foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

section 3. information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation

the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the internal
revenue service. the foundations ein or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. contributions to the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
u.s. federal laws and your states laws.

salt lake city, ut 84116, (801) 596-1887. email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the foundations website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

section 4. information about donations to the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation

project gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states. compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. to send
donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states. u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. to
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

section 5. general information about project gutenbergtm electronic works

professor michael s. hart was the originator of the project
gutenbergtm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. for forty years, he produced and
distributed project gutenbergtm ebooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

project gutenbergtm ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the u.s. unless a copyright notice is included. thus, we do not
necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

most people start at our website which has the main pg search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

this website includes information about project gutenbergtm,
including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation, how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks.
