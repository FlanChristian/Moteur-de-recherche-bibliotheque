 in the trough battery, copper and zinc plates, connected in pairs, divide the trough into cells, which are filled with an acid or oxidizing liquid; the effect is exhibited when wires connected with the two endplates are brought together. in daniell's battery, the metals are zinc and copper, the former in dilute sulphuric acid, or a solution of sulphate of zinc, the latter in a saturated solution of sulphate of copper. a modification of this is the common gravity battery, so called from the automatic action of the two fluids, which are separated by their specific gravities. in grove's battery, platinum is the metal used with zinc; two fluids are used, one of them in a porous cell surrounded by the other. in bunsen's or the carbon battery, the carbon of gas coke is substituted for the platinum of grove's. in leclanch's battery, the elements are zinc in a solution of ammonium chloride, and gas carbon surrounded with manganese dioxide in a porous cell. a secondary battery  is a battery which usually has the two plates of the same kind, generally of lead, in dilute sulphuric acid, and which, when traversed by an electric current, becomes charged, and is then capable of giving a current of itself for a time, owing to chemical changes produced by the charging current. a storage battery is a kind of secondary battery used for accumulating and storing the energy of electrical charges or currents, usually by means of chemical work done by them; an accumulator.

syn.  to beg, ask, request. to ask (not in the sense of inquiring)  is the generic term which embraces all these words. to request is only a polite mode of asking. to beg, in its original sense, was to ask with earnestness, and implied submission, or at least deference. at present, however, in polite life, beg has dropped its original meaning, and has taken the place of both ask and request, on the ground of its expressing more of deference and respect. thus, we beg a person's acceptance of a present; we beg him to favor us with his company; a tradesman begs to announce the arrival of new goods, etc. crabb remarks that, according to present usage, 12we can never talk of asking a person's acceptance of a thing, or of asking him to do us a favor.  this can be more truly said of usage in england than in america.

syn.  benevolence, beneficence, munificence. benevolence marks a disposition made up of a choice and desire for the happiness of others. beneficence marks the working of this disposition in dispensing good on a somewhat broad scale. munificence shows  the same disposition, but acting on a still broader scale, in conferring gifts and favors. these are not necessarily confined to objects of immediate utility. one may show his munificence in presents of pictures or jewelry, but this would not be beneficence. benevolence of heart; beneficence of life; munificence in the encouragement of letters.

syn.  benevolent, beneficent. etymologically considered, benevolent implies wishing well to others, and beneficent, doing well. but by degrees the word benevolent has been widened to include not only feelings, but actions; thus, we speak of benevolent operations, benevolent labors for the public good, benevolent societies. in like manner, beneficent is now often applied to feelings; thus, we speak of the beneficent intentions of a donor. this extension of the terms enables us to mark nicer shades of meaning. thus, the phrase 12benevolent labors  turns attention to the source of these labors, viz., benevolent feeling; while beneficent would simply mark them as productive of good. so, 12beneficent intentions  point to the feelings of the donor as bent upon some specific good act; while 12benevolent intentions  would only denote a general wish and design to do good.

syn.  to beg; to crave.  to beseech, entreat, solicit, implore, supplicate. these words agree in marking that sense of want which leads men to beg some favor. to solicit is to make a request, with some degree of earnestness and repetition, of one whom we address as a superior. to entreat implies greater urgency, usually enforced by adducing reasons or arguments. to beseech is still stronger, and belongs rather to the language of poetry and imagination. to implore denotes increased fervor of entreaty, as addressed either to equals or superiors. to supplicate expresses the extreme of entreaty, and usually implies a state of deep humiliation. thus, a captive supplicates a conqueror to spare his life. men solicit by virtue  of their interest with another; they entreat in the use of reasoning and strong representations; they beseech with importunate earnestness; they implore from a sense of overwhelming distress; they supplicate with a feeling of the most absolute inferiority and dependence.

project gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  it exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future generations.

section 4.  information about donations to the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation

project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states.  compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  to
send donations or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states.  u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
to donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


section 5.  general information about project gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

professor michael s. hart is the originator of the project gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  for thirty years, he produced and distributed project
gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s.
unless a copyright notice is included.  thus, we do not necessarily
keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


most people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

this web site includes information about project gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation, how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks.
