      the fame of gratian, before he had accomplished the twentieth
      year of his age, was equal to that of the most celebrated
      princes. his gentle and amiable disposition endeared him to his
      private friends, the graceful affability of his manners engaged
      the affection of the people: the men of letters, who enjoyed the
      liberality, acknowledged the taste and eloquence, of their
      sovereign; his valor and dexterity in arms were equally applauded
      by the soldiers; and the clergy considered the humble piety of
      gratian as the first and most useful of his virtues. the victory
      of colmar had delivered the west from a formidable invasion; and
      the grateful provinces of the east ascribed the merits of
      theodosius to the author of his greatness, and of the public
      safety. gratian survived those memorable events only four or five
      years; but he survived his reputation; and, before he fell a
      victim to rebellion, he had lost, in a great measure, the respect
      and confidence of the roman world.

      the remarkable alteration of his character or conduct may not be
      imputed to the arts of flattery, which had besieged the son of
      valentinian from his infancy; nor to the headstrong passions
      which the that gentle youth appears to have escaped. a more
      attentive view of the life of gratian may perhaps suggest the
      true cause of the disappointment of the public hopes. his
      apparent virtues, instead of being the hardy productions of
      experience and adversity, were the premature and artificial
      fruits of a royal education. the anxious tenderness of his father
      was continually employed to bestow on him those advantages, which
      he might perhaps esteem the more highly, as he himself had been
      deprived of them; and the most skilful masters of every science,
      and of every art, had labored to form the mind and body of the
      young prince. 1 the knowledge which they painfully communicated
      was displayed with ostentation, and celebrated with lavish
      praise. his soft and tractable disposition received the fair
      impression of their judicious precepts, and the absence of
      passion might easily be mistaken for the strength of reason. his
      preceptors gradually rose to the rank and consequence of
      ministers of state: 2 and, as they wisely dissembled their secret
      authority, he seemed to act with firmness, with propriety, and
      with judgment, on the most important occasions of his life and
      reign. but the influence of this elaborate instruction did not
      penetrate beyond the surface; and the skilful preceptors, who so
      accurately guided the steps of their royal pupil, could not
      infuse into his feeble and indolent character the vigorous and
      independent principle of action which renders the laborious
      pursuit of glory essentially necessary to the happiness, and
      almost to the existence, of the hero. as soon as time and
      accident had removed those faithful counsellors from the throne,
      the emperor of the west insensibly descended to the level of his
      natural genius; abandoned the reins of government to the
      ambitious hands which were stretched forwards to grasp them; and
      amused his leisure with the most frivolous gratifications. a
      public sale of favor and injustice was instituted, both in the
      court and in the provinces, by the worthless delegates of his
      power, whose merit it was made sacrilege to question. 3 the
      conscience of the credulous prince was directed by saints and
      bishops; 4 who procured an imperial edict to punish, as a capital
      offence, the violation, the neglect, or even the ignorance, of
      the divine law. 5 among the various arts which had exercised the
      youth of gratian, he had applied himself, with singular
      inclination and success, to manage the horse, to draw the bow,
      and to dart the javelin; and these qualifications, which might be
      useful to a soldier, were prostituted to the viler purposes of
      hunting. large parks were enclosed for the imperial pleasures,
      and plentifully stocked with every species of wild beasts; and
      gratian neglected the duties, and even the dignity, of his rank,
      to consume whole days in the vain display of his dexterity and
      boldness in the chase. the pride and wish of the roman emperor to
      excel in an art, in which he might be surpassed by the meanest of
      his slaves, reminded the numerous spectators of the examples of
      nero and commodus, but the chaste and temperate gratian was a
      stranger to their monstrous vices; and his hands were stained
      only with the blood of animals. 6 the behavior of gratian, which
      degraded his character in the eyes of mankind, could not have
      disturbed the security of his reign, if the army had not been
      provoked to resent their peculiar injuries. as long as the young
      emperor was guided by the instructions of his masters, he
      professed himself the friend and pupil of the soldiers; many of
      his hours were spent in the familiar conversation of the camp;
      and the health, the comforts, the rewards, the honors, of his
      faithful troops, appeared to be the objects of his attentive
      concern. but, after gratian more freely indulged his prevailing
      taste for hunting and shooting, he naturally connected himself
      with the most dexterous ministers of his favorite amusement. a
      body of the alani was received into the military and domestic
      service of the palace; and the admirable skill, which they were
      accustomed to display in the unbounded plains of scythia, was
      exercised, on a more narrow theatre, in the parks and enclosures
      of gaul. gratian admired the talents and customs of these
      favorite guards, to whom alone he intrusted the defence of his
      person; and, as if he meant to insult the public opinion, he
      frequently showed himself to the soldiers and people, with the
      dress and arms, the long bow, the sounding quiver, and the fur
      garments of a scythian warrior. the unworthy spectacle of a roman
      prince, who had renounced the dress and manners of his country,
      filled the minds of the legions with grief and indignation. 7
      even the germans, so strong and formidable in the armies of the
      empire, affected to disdain the strange and horrid appearance of
      the savages of the north, who, in the space of a few years, had
      wandered from the banks of the volga to those of the seine. a
      loud and licentious murmur was echoed through the camps and
      garrisons of the west; and as the mild indolence of gratian
      neglected to extinguish the first symptoms of discontent, the
      want of love and respect was not supplied by the influence of
      fear. but the subversion of an established government is always a
      work of some real, and of much apparent, difficulty; and the
      throne of gratian was protected by the sanctions of custom, law,
      religion, and the nice balance of the civil and military powers,
      which had been established by the policy of constantine. it is
      not very important to inquire from what cause the revolt of
      britain was produced. accident is commonly the parent of
      disorder; the seeds of rebellion happened to fall on a soil which
      was supposed to be more fruitful than any other in tyrants and
      usurpers; 8 the legions of that sequestered island had been long
      famous for a spirit of presumption and arrogance; 9 and the name
      of maximus was proclaimed, by the tumultuary, but unanimous
      voice, both of the soldiers and of the provincials. the emperor,
      or the rebel,for this title was not yet ascertained by
      fortune,was a native of spain, the countryman, the
      fellow-soldier, and the rival of theodosius whose elevation he
      had not seen without some emotions of envy and resentment: the
      events of his life had long since fixed him in britain; and i
      should not be unwilling to find some evidence for the marriage,
      which he is said to have contracted with the daughter of a
      wealthy lord of caernarvonshire. 10 but this provincial rank
      might justly be considered as a state of exile and obscurity; and
      if maximus had obtained any civil or military office, he was not
      invested with the authority either of governor or general. 11 his
      abilities, and even his integrity, are acknowledged by the
      partial writers of the age; and the merit must indeed have been
      conspicuous that could extort such a confession in favor of the
      vanquished enemy of theodosius. the discontent of maximus might
      incline him to censure the conduct of his sovereign, and to
      encourage, perhaps, without any views of ambition, the murmurs of
      the troops. but in the midst of the tumult, he artfully, or
      modestly, refused to ascend the throne; and some credit appears
      to have been given to his own positive declaration, that he was
      compelled to accept the dangerous present of the imperial purple.

      his son; since he intrusted the education of gratian to ausonius,
      a professed pagan. (mem. de lacademie des inscriptions, tom. xv.

      his age.]

      expressed his gratitude in a servile and insipid piece of
      flattery, (actio gratiarum, p. 699-736,) which has survived more
      worthy productions.]

      subject) his innocence and merit. it is singular enough, that
      maximus should be less favorably treated by zosimus, the partial
      adversary of his rival.]

      but there was danger likewise in refusing the empire; and from
      the moment that maximus had violated his allegiance to his lawful
      sovereign, he could not hope to reign, or even to live, if he
      confined his moderate ambition within the narrow limits of
      britain. he boldly and wisely resolved to prevent the designs of
      gratian; the youth of the island crowded to his standard, and he
      invaded gaul with a fleet and army, which were long afterwards
      remembered, as the emigration of a considerable part of the
      british nation. 13 the emperor, in his peaceful residence of
      paris, was alarmed by their hostile approach; and the darts which
      he idly wasted on lions and bears, might have been employed more
      honorably against the rebels. but his feeble efforts announced
      his degenerate spirit and desperate situation; and deprived him
      of the resources, which he still might have found, in the support
      of his subjects and allies. the armies of gaul, instead of
      opposing the march of maximus, received him with joyful and loyal
      acclamations; and the shame of the desertion was transferred from
      the people to the prince. the troops, whose station more
      immediately attached them to the service of the palace, abandoned
      the standard of gratian the first time that it was displayed in
      the neighborhood of paris. the emperor of the west fled towards
      lyons, with a train of only three hundred horse; and, in the
      cities along the road, where he hoped to find refuge, or at least
      a passage, he was taught, by cruel experience, that every gate is
      shut against the unfortunate. yet he might still have reached, in
      safety, the dominions of his brother; and soon have returned with
      the forces of italy and the east; if he had not suffered himself
      to be fatally deceived by the perfidious governor of the lyonnese
      province. gratian was amused by protestations of doubtful
      fidelity, and the hopes of a support, which could not be
      effectual; till the arrival of andragathius, the general of the
      cavalry of maximus, put an end to his suspense. that resolute
      officer executed, without remorse, the orders or the intention of
      the usurper. gratian, as he rose from supper, was delivered into
      the hands of the assassin: and his body was denied to the pious
      and pressing entreaties of his brother valentinian. 14 the death
      of the emperor was followed by that of his powerful general
      mellobaudes, the king of the franks; who maintained, to the last
      moment of his life, the ambiguous reputation, which is the just
      recompense of obscure and subtle policy. 15 these executions
      might be necessary to the public safety: but the successful
      usurper, whose power was acknowledged by all the provinces of the
      west, had the merit, and the satisfaction, of boasting, that,
      except those who had perished by the chance of war, his triumph
      was not stained by the blood of the romans. 16

      the events of this revolution had passed in such rapid
      succession, that it would have been impossible for theodosius to
      march to the relief of his benefactor, before he received the
      intelligence of his defeat and death. during the season of
      sincere grief, or ostentatious mourning, the eastern emperor was
      interrupted by the arrival of the principal chamberlain of
      maximus; and the choice of a venerable old man, for an office
      which was usually exercised by eunuchs, announced to the court of
      constantinople the gravity and temperance of the british usurper.

      the ambassador condescended to justify, or excuse, the conduct of
      his master; and to protest, in specious language, that the murder
      of gratian had been perpetrated, without his knowledge or
      consent, by the precipitate zeal of the soldiers. but he
      proceeded, in a firm and equal tone, to offer theodosius the
      alternative of peace, or war. the speech of the ambassador
      concluded with a spirited declaration, that although maximus, as
      a roman, and as the father of his people, would choose rather to
      employ his forces in the common defence of the republic, he was
      armed and prepared, if his friendship should be rejected, to
      dispute, in a field of battle, the empire of the world. an
      immediate and peremptory answer was required; but it was
      extremely difficult for theodosius to satisfy, on this important
      occasion, either the feelings of his own mind, or the
      expectations of the public. the imperious voice of honor and
      gratitude called aloud for revenge. from the liberality of
      gratian, he had received the imperial diadem; his patience would
      encourage the odious suspicion, that he was more deeply sensible
      of former injuries, than of recent obligations; and if he
      accepted the friendship, he must seem to share the guilt, of the
      assassin. even the principles of justice, and the interest of
      society, would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of maximus;
      and the example of successful usurpation would tend to dissolve
      the artificial fabric of government, and once more to replunge
      the empire in the crimes and calamities of the preceding age.
      but, as the sentiments of gratitude and honor should invariably
      regulate the conduct of an individual, they may be overbalanced
      in the mind of a sovereign, by the sense of superior duties; and
      the maxims both of justice and humanity must permit the escape of
      an atrocious criminal, if an innocent people would be involved in
      the consequences of his punishment. the assassin of gratian had
      usurped, but he actually possessed, the most warlike provinces of
      the empire: the east was exhausted by the misfortunes, and even
      by the success, of the gothic war; and it was seriously to be
      apprehended, that, after the vital strength of the republic had
      been wasted in a doubtful and destructive contest, the feeble
      conqueror would remain an easy prey to the barbarians of the
      north. these weighty considerations engaged theodosius to
      dissemble his resentment, and to accept the alliance of the
      tyrant. but he stipulated, that maximus should content himself
      with the possession of the countries beyond the alps. the brother
      of gratian was confirmed and secured in the sovereignty of italy,
      africa, and the western illyricum; and some honorable conditions
      were inserted in the treaty, to protect the memory, and the laws,
      of the deceased emperor. 17 according to the custom of the age,
      the images of the three imperial colleagues were exhibited to the
      veneration of the people; nor should it be lightly supposed,
      that, in the moment of a solemn reconciliation, theodosius
      secretly cherished the intention of perfidy and revenge. 18

      abrogavit hostia (tom. ii epist. xvii. p. 827.)]

      odious suspicions; but we cannot reject the treaty of peace which

      mentioned.]

      the contempt of gratian for the roman soldiers had exposed him to
      the fatal effects of their resentment. his profound veneration
      for the christian clergy was rewarded by the applause and
      gratitude of a powerful order, which has claimed, in every age,
      the privilege of dispensing honors, both on earth and in heaven.
      19 the orthodox bishops bewailed his death, and their own
      irreparable loss; but they were soon comforted by the discovery,
      that gratian had committed the sceptre of the east to the hands
      of a prince, whose humble faith and fervent zeal, were supported
      by the spirit and abilities of a more vigorous character. among
      the benefactors of the church, the fame of constantine has been
      rivalled by the glory of theodosius. if constantine had the
      advantage of erecting the standard of the cross, the emulation of
      his successor assumed the merit of subduing the arian heresy, and
      of abolishing the worship of idols in the roman world. theodosius
      was the first of the emperors baptized in the true faith of the
      trinity. although he was born of a christian family, the maxims,
      or at least the practice, of the age, encouraged him to delay the
      ceremony of his initiation; till he was admonished of the danger
      of delay, by the serious illness which threatened his life,
      towards the end of the first year of his reign. before he again
      took the field against the goths, he received the sacrament of
      baptism 20 from acholius, the orthodox bishop of thessalonica: 21
      and, as the emperor ascended from the holy font, still glowing
      with the warm feelings of regeneration, he dictated a solemn
      edict, which proclaimed his own faith, and prescribed the
      religion of his subjects. it is our pleasure (such is the
      imperial style) that all the nations, which are governed by our
      clemency and moderation, should steadfastly adhere to the
      religion which was taught by st. peter to the romans; which
      faithful tradition has preserved; and which is now professed by
      the pontiff damasus, and by peter, bishop of alexandria, a man of
      apostolic holiness. according to the discipline of the apostles,
      and the doctrine of the gospel, let us believe the sole deity of
      the father, the son, and the holy ghost; under an equal majesty,
      and a pious trinity. we authorize the followers of this doctrine
      to assume the title of catholic christians; and as we judge, that
      all others are extravagant madmen, we brand them with the
      infamous name of heretics; and declare that their conventicles
      shall no longer usurp the respectable appellation of churches.
      besides the condemnation of divine justice, they must expect to
      suffer the severe penalties, which our authority, guided by
      heavenly wisdom, shall think proper to inflict upon them. 22 the
      faith of a soldier is commonly the fruit of instruction, rather
      than of inquiry; but as the emperor always fixed his eyes on the
      visible landmarks of orthodoxy, which he had so prudently
      constituted, his religious opinions were never affected by the
      specious texts, the subtle arguments, and the ambiguous creeds of
      the arian doctors. once indeed he expressed a faint inclination
      to converse with the eloquent and learned eunomius, who lived in
      retirement at a small distance from constantinople. but the
      dangerous interview was prevented by the prayers of the empress
      flaccilla, who trembled for the salvation of her husband; and the
      mind of theodosius was confirmed by a theological argument,
      adapted to the rudest capacity. he had lately bestowed on his
      eldest son, arcadius, the name and honors of augustus, and the
      two princes were seated on a stately throne to receive the homage
      of their subjects. a bishop, amphilochius of iconium, approached
      the throne, and after saluting, with due reverence, the person of
      his sovereign, he accosted the royal youth with the same familiar
      tenderness which he might have used towards a plebeian child.
      provoked by this insolent behavior, the monarch gave orders, that
      the rustic priest should be instantly driven from his presence.
      but while the guards were forcing him to the door, the dexterous
      polemic had time to execute his design, by exclaiming, with a
      loud voice, such is the treatment, o emperor! which the king of
      heaven has prepared for those impious men, who affect to worship
      the father, but refuse to acknowledge the equal majesty of his
      divine son. theodosius immediately embraced the bishop of
      iconium, and never forgot the important lesson, which he had
      received from this dramatic parable. 23

      chapter xxvii: civil wars, reign of theodosius.part ii.

      constantinople was the principal seat and fortress of arianism;
      and, in a long interval of forty years, 24 the faith of the
      princes and prelates, who reigned in the capital of the east, was
      rejected in the purer schools of rome and alexandria. the
      archiepiscopal throne of macedonius, which had been polluted with
      so much christian blood, was successively filled by eudoxus and
      damophilus. their diocese enjoyed a free importation of vice and
      error from every province of the empire; the eager pursuit of
      religious controversy afforded a new occupation to the busy
      idleness of the metropolis; and we may credit the assertion of an
      intelligent observer, who describes, with some pleasantry, the
      effects of their loquacious zeal. this city, says he, is full
      of mechanics and slaves, who are all of them profound
      theologians; and preach in the shops, and in the streets. if you
      desire a man to change a piece of silver, he informs you, wherein
      the son differs from the father; if you ask the price of a loaf,
      you are told by way of reply, that the son is inferior to the
      father; and if you inquire, whether the bath is ready, the answer
      is, that the son was made out of nothing. 25 the heretics, of
      various denominations, subsisted in peace under the protection of
      the arians of constantinople; who endeavored to secure the
      attachment of those obscure sectaries, while they abused, with
      unrelenting severity, the victory which they had obtained over
      the followers of the council of nice. during the partial reigns
      of constantius and valens, the feeble remnant of the homoousians
      was deprived of the public and private exercise of their
      religion; and it has been observed, in pathetic language, that
      the scattered flock was left without a shepherd to wander on the
      mountains, or to be devoured by rapacious wolves. 26 but, as
      their zeal, instead of being subdued, derived strength and vigor
      from oppression, they seized the first moments of imperfect
      freedom, which they had acquired by the death of valens, to form
      themselves into a regular congregation, under the conduct of an
      episcopal pastor. two natives of cappadocia, basil, and gregory
      nazianzen, 27 were distinguished above all their contemporaries,
      28 by the rare union of profane eloquence and of orthodox piety.

      these orators, who might sometimes be compared, by themselves,
      and by the public, to the most celebrated of the ancient greeks,
      were united by the ties of the strictest friendship. they had
      cultivated, with equal ardor, the same liberal studies in the
      schools of athens; they had retired, with equal devotion, to the
      same solitude in the deserts of pontus; and every spark of
      emulation, or envy, appeared to be totally extinguished in the
      holy and ingenuous breasts of gregory and basil. but the
      exaltation of basil, from a private life to the archiepiscopal
      throne of caesarea, discovered to the world, and perhaps to
      himself, the pride of his character; and the first favor which he
      condescended to bestow on his friend, was received, and perhaps
      was intended, as a cruel insult. 29 instead of employing the
      superior talents of gregory in some useful and conspicuous
      station, the haughty prelate selected, among the fifty bishoprics
      of his extensive province, the wretched village of sasima, 30
      without water, without verdure, without society, situate at the
      junction of three highways, and frequented only by the incessant
      passage of rude and clamorous wagoners. gregory submitted with
      reluctance to this humiliating exile; he was ordained bishop of
      sasima; but he solemnly protests, that he never consummated his
      spiritual marriage with this disgusting bride. he afterwards
      consented to undertake the government of his native church of
      nazianzus, 31 of which his father had been bishop above
      five-and-forty years. but as he was still conscious that he
      deserved another audience, and another theatre, he accepted, with
      no unworthy ambition, the honorable invitation, which was
      addressed to him from the orthodox party of constantinople. on
      his arrival in the capital, gregory was entertained in the house
      of a pious and charitable kinsman; the most spacious room was
      consecrated to the uses of religious worship; and the name of
      anastasia was chosen to express the resurrection of the nicene
      faith. this private conventicle was afterwards converted into a
      magnificent church; and the credulity of the succeeding age was
      prepared to believe the miracles and visions, which attested the
      presence, or at least the protection, of the mother of god. 32
      the pulpit of the anastasia was the scene of the labors and
      triumphs of gregory nazianzen; and, in the space of two years, he
      experienced all the spiritual adventures which constitute the
      prosperous or adverse fortunes of a missionary. 33 the arians,
      who were provoked by the boldness of his enterprise, represented
      his doctrine, as if he had preached three distinct and equal
      deities; and the devout populace was excited to suppress, by
      violence and tumult, the irregular assemblies of the athanasian
      heretics. from the cathedral of st. sophia there issued a motley
      crowd of common beggars, who had forfeited their claim to pity;
      of monks, who had the appearance of goats or satyrs; and of
      women, more terrible than so many jezebels. the doors of the
      anastasia were broke open; much mischief was perpetrated, or
      attempted, with sticks, stones, and firebrands; and as a man lost
      his life in the affray, gregory, who was summoned the next
      morning before the magistrate, had the satisfaction of supposing,
      that he publicly confessed the name of christ. after he was
      delivered from the fear and danger of a foreign enemy, his infant
      church was disgraced and distracted by intestine faction. a
      stranger who assumed the name of maximus, 34 and the cloak of a
      cynic philosopher, insinuated himself into the confidence of
      gregory; deceived and abused his favorable opinion; and forming a
      secret connection with some bishops of egypt, attempted, by a
      clandestine ordination, to supplant his patron in the episcopal
      seat of constantinople. these mortifications might sometimes
      tempt the cappadocian missionary to regret his obscure solitude.
      but his fatigues were rewarded by the daily increase of his fame
      and his congregation; and he enjoyed the pleasure of observing,
      that the greater part of his numerous audience retired from his
      sermons satisfied with the eloquence of the preacher, 35 or
      dissatisfied with the manifold imperfections of their faith and
      practice. 36

      constantinople. the zeal of damophilus, which in a catholic saint
      would have been justly applauded, embraced, without hesitation, a
      life of poverty and exile, 37 and his removal was immediately
      followed by the purification of the imperial city. the arians
      might complain, with some appearance of justice, that an
      inconsiderable congregation of sectaries should usurp the hundred
      churches, which they were insufficient to fill; whilst the far
      greater part of the people was cruelly excluded from every place
      of religious worship. theodosius was still inexorable; but as the
      angels who protected the catholic cause were only visible to the
      eyes of faith, he prudently reenforced those heavenly legions
      with the more effectual aid of temporal and carnal weapons; and
      the church of st. sophia was occupied by a large body of the
      imperial guards. if the mind of gregory was susceptible of pride,
      he must have felt a very lively satisfaction, when the emperor
      conducted him through the streets in solemn triumph; and, with
      his own hand, respectfully placed him on the archiepiscopal
      throne of constantinople. but the saint (who had not subdued the
      imperfections of human virtue) was deeply affected by the
      mortifying consideration, that his entrance into the fold was
      that of a wolf, rather than of a shepherd; that the glittering
      arms which surrounded his person, were necessary for his safety;
      and that he alone was the object of the imprecations of a great
      party, whom, as men and citizens, it was impossible for him to
      despise. he beheld the innumerable multitude of either sex, and
      of every age, who crowded the streets, the windows, and the roofs
      of the houses; he heard the tumultuous voice of rage, grief,
      astonishment, and despair; and gregory fairly confesses, that on
      the memorable day of his installation, the capital of the east
      wore the appearance of a city taken by storm, and in the hands of
      a barbarian conqueror. 38 about six weeks afterwards, theodosius
      declared his resolution of expelling from all the churches of his
      dominions the bishops and their clergy who should obstinately
      refuse to believe, or at least to profess, the doctrine of the
      council of nice. his lieutenant, sapor, was armed with the ample
      powers of a general law, a special commission, and a military
      force; 39 and this ecclesiastical revolution was conducted with
      so much discretion and vigor, that the religion of the emperor
      was established, without tumult or bloodshed, in all the
      provinces of the east. the writings of the arians, if they had
      been permitted to exist, 40 would perhaps contain the lamentable
      story of the persecution, which afflicted the church under the
      reign of the impious theodosius; and the sufferings of their holy
      confessors might claim the pity of the disinterested reader. yet
      there is reason to imagine, that the violence of zeal and revenge
      was, in some measure, eluded by the want of resistance; and that,
      in their adversity, the arians displayed much less firmness than
      had been exerted by the orthodox party under the reigns of
      constantius and valens. the moral character and conduct of the
      hostile sects appear to have been governed by the same common
      principles of nature and religion: but a very material
      circumstance may be discovered, which tended to distinguish the
      degrees of their theological faith. both parties, in the schools,
      as well as in the temples, acknowledged and worshipped the divine
      majesty of christ; and, as we are always prone to impute our own
      sentiments and passions to the deity, it would be deemed more
      prudent and respectful to exaggerate, than to circumscribe, the
      adorable perfections of the son of god. the disciple of
      athanasius exulted in the proud confidence, that he had entitled
      himself to the divine favor; while the follower of arius must
      have been tormented by the secret apprehension, that he was
      guilty, perhaps, of an unpardonable offence, by the scanty
      praise, and parsimonious honors, which he bestowed on the judge
      of the world. the opinions of arianism might satisfy a cold and
      speculative mind: but the doctrine of the nicene creed, most
      powerfully recommended by the merits of faith and devotion, was
      much better adapted to become popular and successful in a
      believing age.

      the hope, that truth and wisdom would be found in the assemblies
      of the orthodox clergy, induced the emperor to convene, at
      constantinople, a synod of one hundred and fifty bishops, who
      proceeded, without much difficulty or delay, to complete the
      theological system which had been established in the council of
      nice. the vehement disputes of the fourth century had been
      chiefly employed on the nature of the son of god; and the various
      opinions which were embraced, concerning the second, were
      extended and transferred, by a natural analogy, to the third
      person of the trinity. 41 yet it was found, or it was thought,
      necessary, by the victorious adversaries of arianism, to explain
      the ambiguous language of some respectable doctors; to confirm
      the faith of the catholics; and to condemn an unpopular and
      inconsistent sect of macedonians; who freely admitted that the
      son was consubstantial to the father, while they were fearful of
      seeming to acknowledge the existence of three gods. a final and
      unanimous sentence was pronounced to ratify the equal deity of
      the holy ghost: the mysterious doctrine has been received by all
      the nations, and all the churches of the christian world; and
      their grateful reverence has assigned to the bishops of
      theodosius the second rank among the general councils. 42 their
      knowledge of religious truth may have been preserved by
      tradition, or it may have been communicated by inspiration; but
      the sober evidence of history will not allow much weight to the
      personal authority of the fathers of constantinople. in an age
      when the ecclesiastics had scandalously degenerated from the
      model of apostolic purity, the most worthless and corrupt were
      always the most eager to frequent, and disturb, the episcopal
      assemblies. the conflict and fermentation of so many opposite
      interests and tempers inflamed the passions of the bishops: and
      their ruling passions were, the love of gold, and the love of
      dispute. many of the same prelates who now applauded the orthodox
      piety of theodosius, had repeatedly changed, with prudent
      flexibility, their creeds and opinions; and in the various
      revolutions of the church and state, the religion of their
      sovereign was the rule of their obsequious faith. when the
      emperor suspended his prevailing influence, the turbulent synod
      was blindly impelled by the absurd or selfish motives of pride,
      hatred, or resentment. the death of meletius, which happened at
      the council of constantinople, presented the most favorable
      opportunity of terminating the schism of antioch, by suffering
      his aged rival, paulinus, peaceably to end his days in the
      episcopal chair. the faith and virtues of paulinus were
      unblemished. but his cause was supported by the western churches;
      and the bishops of the synod resolved to perpetuate the mischiefs
      of discord, by the hasty ordination of a perjured candidate, 43
      rather than to betray the imagined dignity of the east, which had
      been illustrated by the birth and death of the son of god. such
      unjust and disorderly proceedings forced the gravest members of
      the assembly to dissent and to secede; and the clamorous majority
      which remained masters of the field of battle, could be compared
      only to wasps or magpies, to a flight of cranes, or to a flock of
      geese. 44

      deified the father and the son without the holy ghost, that they
      might as well be styled tritheists as ditheists. gregory himself

      a suspicion may possibly arise, that so unfavorable a picture of
      ecclesiastical synods has been drawn by the partial hand of some
      obstinate heretic, or some malicious infidel. but the name of the
      sincere historian who has conveyed this instructive lesson to the
      knowledge of posterity, must silence the impotent murmurs of
      superstition and bigotry. he was one of the most pious and
      eloquent bishops of the age; a saint, and a doctor of the church;
      the scourge of arianism, and the pillar of the orthodox faith; a
      distinguished member of the council of constantinople, in which,
      after the death of meletius, he exercised the functions of
      president; in a wordgregory nazianzen himself. the harsh and
      ungenerous treatment which he experienced, 45 instead of
      derogating from the truth of his evidence, affords an additional
      proof of the spirit which actuated the deliberations of the
      synod. their unanimous suffrage had confirmed the pretensions
      which the bishop of constantinople derived from the choice of the
      people, and the approbation of the emperor. but gregory soon
      became the victim of malice and envy. the bishops of the east,
      his strenuous adherents, provoked by his moderation in the
      affairs of antioch, abandoned him, without support, to the
      adverse faction of the egyptians; who disputed the validity of
      his election, and rigorously asserted the obsolete canon, that
      prohibited the licentious practice of episcopal translations. the
      pride, or the humility, of gregory prompted him to decline a
      contest which might have been imputed to ambition and avarice;
      and he publicly offered, not without some mixture of indignation,
      to renounce the government of a church which had been restored,
      and almost created, by his labors. his resignation was accepted
      by the synod, and by the emperor, with more readiness than he
      seems to have expected. at the time when he might have hoped to
      enjoy the fruits of his victory, his episcopal throne was filled
      by the senator nectarius; and the new archbishop, accidentally
      recommended by his easy temper and venerable aspect, was obliged
      to delay the ceremony of his consecration, till he had previously
      despatched the rites of his baptism. 46 after this remarkable
      experience of the ingratitude of princes and prelates, gregory
      retired once more to his obscure solitude of cappadocia; where he
      employed the remainder of his life, about eight years, in the
      exercises of poetry and devotion. the title of saint has been
      added to his name: but the tenderness of his heart, 47 and the
      elegance of his genius, reflect a more pleasing lustre on the
      memory of gregory nazianzen.

      it was not enough that theodosius had suppressed the insolent
      reign of arianism, or that he had abundantly revenged the
      injuries which the catholics sustained from the zeal of
      constantius and valens. the orthodox emperor considered every
      heretic as a rebel against the supreme powers of heaven and of
      earth; and each of those powers might exercise their peculiar
      jurisdiction over the soul and body of the guilty. the decrees of
      the council of constantinople had ascertained the true standard
      of the faith; and the ecclesiastics, who governed the conscience
      of theodosius, suggested the most effectual methods of
      persecution. in the space of fifteen years, he promulgated at
      least fifteen severe edicts against the heretics; 48 more
      especially against those who rejected the doctrine of the
      trinity; and to deprive them of every hope of escape, he sternly
      enacted, that if any laws or rescripts should be alleged in their
      favor, the judges should consider them as the illegal productions
      either of fraud or forgery. the penal statutes were directed
      against the ministers, the assemblies, and the persons of the
      heretics; and the passions of the legislator were expressed in
      the language of declamation and invective. i. the heretical
      teachers, who usurped the sacred titles of bishops, or
      presbyters, were not only excluded from the privileges and
      emoluments so liberally granted to the orthodox clergy, but they
      were exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and confiscation, if
      they presumed to preach the doctrine, or to practise the rites,
      of their accursed sects. a fine of ten pounds of gold (above four
      hundred pounds sterling) was imposed on every person who should
      dare to confer, or receive, or promote, an heretical ordination:
      and it was reasonably expected, that if the race of pastors could
      be extinguished, their helpless flocks would be compelled, by
      ignorance and hunger, to return within the pale of the catholic
      church. ii. the rigorous prohibition of conventicles was
      carefully extended to every possible circumstance, in which the
      heretics could assemble with the intention of worshipping god and
      christ according to the dictates of their conscience. their
      religious meetings, whether public or secret, by day or by night,
      in cities or in the country, were equally proscribed by the
      edicts of theodosius; and the building, or ground, which had been
      used for that illegal purpose, was forfeited to the imperial
      domain. iii. it was supposed, that the error of the heretics
      could proceed only from the obstinate temper of their minds; and
      that such a temper was a fit object of censure and punishment.
      the anathemas of the church were fortified by a sort of civil
      excommunication; which separated them from their fellow-citizens,
      by a peculiar brand of infamy; and this declaration of the
      supreme magistrate tended to justify, or at least to excuse, the
      insults of a fanatic populace. the sectaries were gradually
      disqualified from the possession of honorable or lucrative
      employments; and theodosius was satisfied with his own justice,
      when he decreed, that, as the eunomians distinguished the nature
      of the son from that of the father, they should be incapable of
      making their wills or of receiving any advantage from
      testamentary donations. the guilt of the manichaean heresy was
      esteemed of such magnitude, that it could be expiated only by the
      death of the offender; and the same capital punishment was
      inflicted on the audians, or quartodecimans, 49 who should dare
      to perpetrate the atrocious crime of celebrating on an improper
      day the festival of easter. every roman might exercise the right
      of public accusation; but the office of inquisitors of the faith,
      a name so deservedly abhorred, was first instituted under the
      reign of theodosius. yet we are assured, that the execution of
      his penal edicts was seldom enforced; and that the pious emperor
      appeared less desirous to punish, than to reclaim, or terrify,
      his refractory subjects. 50

      the theory of persecution was established by theodosius, whose
      justice and piety have been applauded by the saints: but the
      practice of it, in the fullest extent, was reserved for his rival
      and colleague, maximus, the first, among the christian princes,
      who shed the blood of his christian subjects on account of their
      religious opinions. the cause of the priscillianists, 51 a recent
      sect of heretics, who disturbed the provinces of spain, was
      transferred, by appeal, from the synod of bordeaux to the
      imperial consistory of treves; and by the sentence of the
      prtorian prfect, seven persons were tortured, condemned, and
      executed. the first of these was priscillian 52 himself, bishop
      of avila, in spain; who adorned the advantages of birth and
      fortune, by the accomplishments of eloquence and learning. 53 two
      presbyters, and two deacons, accompanied their beloved master in
      his death, which they esteemed as a glorious martyrdom; and the
      number of religious victims was completed by the execution of
      latronian, a poet, who rivalled the fame of the ancients; and of
      euchrocia, a noble matron of bordeaux, the widow of the orator
      delphidius. 54 two bishops who had embraced the sentiments of
      priscillian, were condemned to a distant and dreary exile; 55 and
      some indulgence was shown to the meaner criminals, who assumed
      the merit of an early repentance. if any credit could be allowed
      to confessions extorted by fear or pain, and to vague reports,
      the offspring of malice and credulity, the heresy of the
      priscillianists would be found to include the various
      abominations of magic, of impiety, and of lewdness. 56
      priscillian, who wandered about the world in the company of his
      spiritual sisters, was accused of praying stark naked in the
      midst of the congregation; and it was confidently asserted, that
      the effects of his criminal intercourse with the daughter of
      euchrocia had been suppressed, by means still more odious and
      criminal. but an accurate, or rather a candid, inquiry will
      discover, that if the priscillianists violated the laws of
      nature, it was not by the licentiousness, but by the austerity,
      of their lives. they absolutely condemned the use of the
      marriage-bed; and the peace of families was often disturbed by
      indiscreet separations. they enjoyed, or recommended, a total
      abstinence from all animal food; and their continual prayers,
      fasts, and vigils, inculcated a rule of strict and perfect
      devotion. the speculative tenets of the sect, concerning the
      person of christ, and the nature of the human soul, were derived
      from the gnostic and manichaean system; and this vain philosophy,
      which had been transported from egypt to spain, was ill adapted
      to the grosser spirits of the west. the obscure disciples of
      priscillian suffered languished, and gradually disappeared: his
      tenets were rejected by the clergy and people, but his death was
      the subject of a long and vehement controversy; while some
      arraigned, and others applauded, the justice of his sentence. it
      is with pleasure that we can observe the humane inconsistency of
      the most illustrious saints and bishops, ambrose of milan, 57 and
      martin of tours, 58 who, on this occasion, asserted the cause of
      toleration. they pitied the unhappy men, who had been executed at
      treves; they refused to hold communion with their episcopal
      murderers; and if martin deviated from that generous resolution,
      his motives were laudable, and his repentance was exemplary. the
      bishops of tours and milan pronounced, without hesitation, the
      eternal damnation of heretics; but they were surprised, and
      shocked, by the bloody image of their temporal death, and the
      honest feelings of nature resisted the artificial prejudices of
      theology. the humanity of ambrose and martin was confirmed by the
      scandalous irregularity of the proceedings against priscillian
      and his adherents. the civil and ecclesiastical ministers had
      transgressed the limits of their respective provinces. the
      secular judge had presumed to receive an appeal, and to pronounce
      a definitive sentence, in a matter of faith, and episcopal
      jurisdiction. the bishops had disgraced themselves, by exercising
      the functions of accusers in a criminal prosecution. the cruelty
      of ithacius, 59 who beheld the tortures, and solicited the death,
      of the heretics, provoked the just indignation of mankind; and
      the vices of that profligate bishop were admitted as a proof,
      that his zeal was instigated by the sordid motives of interest.
      since the death of priscillian, the rude attempts of persecution
      have been refined and methodized in the holy office, which
      assigns their distinct parts to the ecclesiastical and secular
      powers. the devoted victim is regularly delivered by the priest
      to the magistrate, and by the magistrate to the executioner; and
      the inexorable sentence of the church, which declares the
      spiritual guilt of the offender, is expressed in the mild
      language of pity and intercession.

      chapter xxvii: civil wars, reign of theodosius.part iii.

      among the ecclesiastics, who illustrated the reign of theodosius,
      gregory nazianzen was distinguished by the talents of an eloquent
      preacher; the reputation of miraculous gifts added weight and
      dignity to the monastic virtues of martin of tours; 60 but the
      palm of episcopal vigor and ability was justly claimed by the
      intrepid ambrose. 61 he was descended from a noble family of
      romans; his father had exercised the important office of
      prtorian prfect of gaul; and the son, after passing through
      the studies of a liberal education, attained, in the regular
      gradation of civil honors, the station of consular of liguria, a
      province which included the imperial residence of milan. at the
      age of thirty-four, and before he had received the sacrament of
      baptism, ambrose, to his own surprise, and to that of the world,
      was suddenly transformed from a governor to an archbishop.
      without the least mixture, as it is said, of art or intrigue, the
      whole body of the people unanimously saluted him with the
      episcopal title; the concord and perseverance of their
      acclamations were ascribed to a praeternatural impulse; and the
      reluctant magistrate was compelled to undertake a spiritual
      office, for which he was not prepared by the habits and
      occupations of his former life. but the active force of his
      genius soon qualified him to exercise, with zeal and prudence,
      the duties of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and while he
      cheerfully renounced the vain and splendid trappings of temporal
      greatness, he condescended, for the good of the church, to direct
      the conscience of the emperors, and to control the administration
      of the empire. gratian loved and revered him as a father; and the
      elaborate treatise on the faith of the trinity was designed for
      the instruction of the young prince. after his tragic death, at a
      time when the empress justina trembled for her own safety, and
      for that of her son valentinian, the archbishop of milan was
      despatched, on two different embassies, to the court of treves.
      he exercised, with equal firmness and dexterity, the powers of
      his spiritual and political characters; and perhaps contributed,
      by his authority and eloquence, to check the ambition of maximus,
      and to protect the peace of italy. 62 ambrose had devoted his
      life, and his abilities, to the service of the church. wealth was
      the object of his contempt; he had renounced his private
      patrimony; and he sold, without hesitation, the consecrated
      plate, for the redemption of captives. the clergy and people of
      milan were attached to their archbishop; and he deserved the
      esteem, without soliciting the favor, or apprehending the
      displeasure, of his feeble sovereigns.

      the government of italy, and of the young emperor, naturally
      devolved to his mother justina, a woman of beauty and spirit, but
      who, in the midst of an orthodox people, had the misfortune of
      professing the arian heresy, which she endeavored to instil into
      the mind of her son. justina was persuaded, that a roman emperor
      might claim, in his own dominions, the public exercise of his
      religion; and she proposed to the archbishop, as a moderate and
      reasonable concession, that he should resign the use of a single
      church, either in the city or the suburbs of milan. but the
      conduct of ambrose was governed by very different principles. 63
      the palaces of the earth might indeed belong to caesar; but the
      churches were the houses of god; and, within the limits of his
      diocese, he himself, as the lawful successor of the apostles, was
      the only minister of god. the privileges of christianity,
      temporal as well as spiritual, were confined to the true
      believers; and the mind of ambrose was satisfied, that his own
      theological opinions were the standard of truth and orthodoxy.
      the archbishop, who refused to hold any conference, or
      negotiation, with the instruments of satan, declared, with modest
      firmness, his resolution to die a martyr, rather than to yield to
      the impious sacrilege; and justina, who resented the refusal as
      an act of insolence and rebellion, hastily determined to exert
      the imperial prerogative of her son. as she desired to perform
      her public devotions on the approaching festival of easter,
      ambrose was ordered to appear before the council. he obeyed the
      summons with the respect of a faithful subject, but he was
      followed, without his consent, by an innumerable people; they
      pressed, with impetuous zeal, against the gates of the palace;
      and the affrighted ministers of valentinian, instead of
      pronouncing a sentence of exile on the archbishop of milan,
      humbly requested that he would interpose his authority, to
      protect the person of the emperor, and to restore the tranquility
      of the capital. but the promises which ambrose received and
      communicated were soon violated by a perfidious court; and,
      during six of the most solemn days, which christian piety had set
      apart for the exercise of religion, the city was agitated by the
      irregular convulsions of tumult and fanaticism. the officers of
      the household were directed to prepare, first, the portian, and
      afterwards, the new, basilica, for the immediate reception of the
      emperor and his mother. the splendid canopy and hangings of the
      royal seat were arranged in the customary manner; but it was
      found necessary to defend them. by a strong guard, from the
      insults of the populace. the arian ecclesiastics, who ventured to
      show themselves in the streets, were exposed to the most imminent
      danger of their lives; and ambrose enjoyed the merit and
      reputation of rescuing his personal enemies from the hands of the
      enraged multitude.

      63 (return) [ his own representation of his principles and
      conduct (tom. ii. epist. xx xxi. xxii. p. 852-880) is one of the
      curious monuments of ecclesiastical antiquity. it contains two
      letters to his sister marcellina, with a petition to valentinian
      and the sermon de basilicis non madendis.]

      but while he labored to restrain the effects of their zeal, the
      pathetic vehemence of his sermons continually inflamed the angry
      and seditious temper of the people of milan. the characters of
      eve, of the wife of job, of jezebel, of herodias, were indecently
      applied to the mother of the emperor; and her desire to obtain a
      church for the arians was compared to the most cruel persecutions
      which christianity had endured under the reign of paganism. the
      measures of the court served only to expose the magnitude of the
      evil. a fine of two hundred pounds of gold was imposed on the
      corporate body of merchants and manufacturers: an order was
      signified, in the name of the emperor, to all the officers, and
      inferior servants, of the courts of justice, that, during the
      continuance of the public disorders, they should strictly confine
      themselves to their houses; and the ministers of valentinian
      imprudently confessed, that the most respectable part of the
      citizens of milan was attached to the cause of their archbishop.
      he was again solicited to restore peace to his country, by timely
      compliance with the will of his sovereign. the reply of ambrose
      was couched in the most humble and respectful terms, which might,
      however, be interpreted as a serious declaration of civil war.
      his life and fortune were in the hands of the emperor; but he
      would never betray the church of christ, or degrade the dignity
      of the episcopal character. in such a cause he was prepared to
      suffer whatever the malice of the daemon could inflict; and he
      only wished to die in the presence of his faithful flock, and at
      the foot of the altar; he had not contributed to excite, but it
      was in the power of god alone to appease, the rage of the people:
      he deprecated the scenes of blood and confusion which were likely
      to ensue; and it was his fervent prayer, that he might not
      survive to behold the ruin of a flourishing city, and perhaps the
      desolation of all italy. 64 the obstinate bigotry of justina
      would have endangered the empire of her son, if, in this contest
      with the church and people of milan, she could have depended on
      the active obedience of the troops of the palace. a large body of
      goths had marched to occupy the basilica, which was the object of
      the dispute: and it might be expected from the arian principles,
      and barbarous manners, of these foreign mercenaries, that they
      would not entertain any scruples in the execution of the most
      sanguinary orders. they were encountered, on the sacred
      threshold, by the archbishop, who, thundering against them a
      sentence of excommunication, asked them, in the tone of a father
      and a master, whether it was to invade the house of god, that
      they had implored the hospitable protection of the republic. the
      suspense of the barbarians allowed some hours for a more
      effectual negotiation; and the empress was persuaded, by the
      advice of her wisest counsellors, to leave the catholics in
      possession of all the churches of milan; and to dissemble, till a
      more convenient season, her intentions of revenge. the mother of
      valentinian could never forgive the triumph of ambrose; and the
      royal youth uttered a passionate exclamation, that his own
      servants were ready to betray him into the hands of an insolent
      priest.

      the causes or the men yet the coadjutor himself had some idea (p.
      84) of imitating st. ambrose]

      the laws of the empire, some of which were inscribed with the
      name of valentinian, still condemned the arian heresy, and seemed
      to excuse the resistance of the catholics. by the influence of
      justina, an edict of toleration was promulgated in all the
      provinces which were subject to the court of milan; the free
      exercise of their religion was granted to those who professed the
      faith of rimini; and the emperor declared, that all persons who
      should infringe this sacred and salutary constitution, should be
      capitally punished, as the enemies of the public peace. 65 the
      character and language of the archbishop of milan may justify the
      suspicion, that his conduct soon afforded a reasonable ground, or
      at least a specious pretence, to the arian ministers; who watched
      the opportunity of surprising him in some act of disobedience to
      a law which he strangely represents as a law of blood and
      tyranny. a sentence of easy and honorable banishment was
      pronounced, which enjoined ambrose to depart from milan without
      delay; whilst it permitted him to choose the place of his exile,
      and the number of his companions. but the authority of the
      saints, who have preached and practised the maxims of passive
      loyalty, appeared to ambrose of less moment than the extreme and
      pressing danger of the church. he boldly refused to obey; and his
      refusal was supported by the unanimous consent of his faithful
      people. 66 they guarded by turns the person of their archbishop;
      the gates of the cathedral and the episcopal palace were strongly
      secured; and the imperial troops, who had formed the blockade,
      were unwilling to risk the attack, of that impregnable fortress.
      the numerous poor, who had been relieved by the liberality of
      ambrose, embraced the fair occasion of signalizing their zeal and
      gratitude; and as the patience of the multitude might have been
      exhausted by the length and uniformity of nocturnal vigils, he
      prudently introduced into the church of milan the useful
      institution of a loud and regular psalmody. while he maintained
      this arduous contest, he was instructed, by a dream, to open the
      earth in a place where the remains of two martyrs, gervasius and
      protasius, 67 had been deposited above three hundred years.
      immediately under the pavement of the church two perfect
      skeletons were found, 68 with the heads separated from their
      bodies, and a plentiful effusion of blood. the holy relics were
      presented, in solemn pomp, to the veneration of the people; and
      every circumstance of this fortunate discovery was admirably
      adapted to promote the designs of ambrose. the bones of the
      martyrs, their blood, their garments, were supposed to contain a
      healing power; and the praeternatural influence was communicated
      to the most distant objects, without losing any part of its
      original virtue. the extraordinary cure of a blind man, 69 and
      the reluctant confessions of several daemoniacs, appeared to
      justify the faith and sanctity of ambrose; and the truth of those
      miracles is attested by ambrose himself, by his secretary
      paulinus, and by his proselyte, the celebrated augustin, who, at
      that time, professed the art of rhetoric in milan. the reason of
      the present age may possibly approve the incredulity of justina
      and her arian court; who derided the theatrical representations
      which were exhibited by the contrivance, and at the expense, of
      the archbishop. 70 their effect, however, on the minds of the
      people, was rapid and irresistible; and the feeble sovereign of
      italy found himself unable to contend with the favorite of
      heaven. the powers likewise of the earth interposed in the
      defence of ambrose: the disinterested advice of theodosius was
      the genuine result of piety and friendship; and the mask of
      religious zeal concealed the hostile and ambitious designs of the
      tyrant of gaul. 71

      the reign of maximus might have ended in peace and prosperity,
      could he have contented himself with the possession of three
      ample countries, which now constitute the three most flourishing
      kingdoms of modern europe. but the aspiring usurper, whose sordid
      ambition was not dignified by the love of glory and of arms,
      considered his actual forces as the instruments only of his
      future greatness, and his success was the immediate cause of his
      destruction. the wealth which he extorted 72 from the oppressed
      provinces of gaul, spain, and britain, was employed in levying
      and maintaining a formidable army of barbarians, collected, for
      the most part, from the fiercest nations of germany. the conquest
      of italy was the object of his hopes and preparations: and he
      secretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth, whose
      government was abhorred and despised by his catholic subjects.
      but as maximus wished to occupy, without resistance, the passes
      of the alps, he received, with perfidious smiles, domninus of
      syria, the ambassador of valentinian, and pressed him to accept
      the aid of a considerable body of troops, for the service of a
      pannonian war. the penetration of ambrose had discovered the
      snares of an enemy under the professions of friendship; 73 but
      the syrian domninus was corrupted, or deceived, by the liberal
      favor of the court of treves; and the council of milan
      obstinately rejected the suspicion of danger, with a blind
      confidence, which was the effect, not of courage, but of fear.
      the march of the auxiliaries was guided by the ambassador; and
      they were admitted, without distrust, into the fortresses of the
      alps. but the crafty tyrant followed, with hasty and silent
      footsteps, in the rear; and, as he diligently intercepted all
      intelligence of his motions, the gleam of armor, and the dust
      excited by the troops of cavalry, first announced the hostile
      approach of a stranger to the gates of milan. in this extremity,
      justina and her son might accuse their own imprudence, and the
      perfidious arts of maximus; but they wanted time, and force, and
      resolution, to stand against the gauls and germans, either in the
      field, or within the walls of a large and disaffected city.
      flight was their only hope, aquileia their only refuge; and as
      maximus now displayed his genuine character, the brother of
      gratian might expect the same fate from the hands of the same
      assassin. maximus entered milan in triumph; and if the wise
      archbishop refused a dangerous and criminal connection with the
      usurper, he might indirectly contribute to the success of his
      arms, by inculcating, from the pulpit, the duty of resignation,
      rather than that of resistance. 74 the unfortunate justina
      reached aquileia in safety; but she distrusted the strength of
      the fortifications: she dreaded the event of a siege; and she
      resolved to implore the protection of the great theodosius, whose
      power and virtue were celebrated in all the countries of the
      west. a vessel was secretly provided to transport the imperial
      family; they embarked with precipitation in one of the obscure
      harbors of venetia, or istria; traversed the whole extent of the
      adriatic and ionian seas; turned the extreme promontory of
      peloponnesus; and, after a long, but successful navigation,
      reposed themselves in the port of thessalonica. all the subjects
      of valentinian deserted the cause of a prince, who, by his
      abdication, had absolved them from the duty of allegiance; and if
      the little city of aemona, on the verge of italy, had not
      presumed to stop the career of his inglorious victory, maximus
      would have obtained, without a struggle, the sole possession of
      the western empire.

      instead of inviting his royal guests to take the palace of
      constantinople, theodosius had some unknown reasons to fix their
      residence at thessalonica; but these reasons did not proceed from
      contempt or indifference, as he speedily made a visit to that
      city, accompanied by the greatest part of his court and senate.
      after the first tender expressions of friendship and sympathy,
      the pious emperor of the east gently admonished justina, that the
      guilt of heresy was sometimes punished in this world, as well as
      in the next; and that the public profession of the nicene faith
      would be the most efficacious step to promote the restoration of
      her son, by the satisfaction which it must occasion both on earth
      and in heaven. the momentous question of peace or war was
      referred, by theodosius, to the deliberation of his council; and
      the arguments which might be alleged on the side of honor and
      justice, had acquired, since the death of gratian, a considerable
      degree of additional weight. the persecution of the imperial
      family, to which theodosius himself had been indebted for his
      fortune, was now aggravated by recent and repeated injuries.
      neither oaths nor treaties could restrain the boundless ambition
      of maximus; and the delay of vigorous and decisive measures,
      instead of prolonging the blessings of peace, would expose the
      eastern empire to the danger of a hostile invasion. the
      barbarians, who had passed the danube, had lately assumed the
      character of soldiers and subjects, but their native fierceness
      was yet untamed: and the operations of a war, which would
      exercise their valor, and diminish their numbers, might tend to
      relieve the provinces from an intolerable oppression.
      notwithstanding these specious and solid reasons, which were
      approved by a majority of the council, theodosius still hesitated
      whether he should draw the sword in a contest which could no
      longer admit any terms of reconciliation; and his magnanimous
      character was not disgraced by the apprehensions which he felt
      for the safety of his infant sons, and the welfare of his
      exhausted people. in this moment of anxious doubt, while the fate
      of the roman world depended on the resolution of a single man,
      the charms of the princess galla most powerfully pleaded the
      cause of her brother valentinian. 75 the heart of theodosius wa
      softened by the tears of beauty; his affections were insensibly
      engaged by the graces of youth and innocence: the art of justina
      managed and directed the impulse of passion; and the celebration
      of the royal nuptials was the assurance and signal of the civil
      war. the unfeeling critics, who consider every amorous weakness
      as an indelible stain on the memory of a great and orthodox
      emperor, are inclined, on this occasion, to dispute the
      suspicious evidence of the historian zosimus. for my own part, i
      shall frankly confess, that i am willing to find, or even to
      seek, in the revolutions of the world, some traces of the mild
      and tender sentiments of domestic life; and amidst the crowd of
      fierce and ambitious conquerors, i can distinguish, with peculiar
      complacency, a gentle hero, who may be supposed to receive his
      armor from the hands of love. the alliance of the persian king
      was secured by the faith of treaties; the martial barbarians were
      persuaded to follow the standard, or to respect the frontiers, of
      an active and liberal monarch; and the dominions of theodosius,
      from the euphrates to the adriatic, resounded with the
      preparations of war both by land and sea. the skilful disposition
      of the forces of the east seemed to multiply their numbers, and
      distracted the attention of maximus. he had reason to fear, that
      a chosen body of troops, under the command of the intrepid
      arbogastes, would direct their march along the banks of the
      danube, and boldly penetrate through the rhaetian provinces into
      the centre of gaul. a powerful fleet was equipped in the harbors
      of greece and epirus, with an apparent design, that, as soon as
      the passage had been opened by a naval victory, valentinian and
      his mother should land in italy, proceed, without delay, to rome,
      and occupy the majestic seat of religion and empire. in the mean
      while, theodosius himself advanced at the head of a brave and
      disciplined army, to encounter his unworthy rival, who, after the
      siege of aemona, 7511 had fixed his camp in the neighborhood of
      siscia, a city of pannonia, strongly fortified by the broad and
      rapid stream of the save.

      chapter xxvii: civil wars, reign of theodosius.part iv.

      the veterans, who still remembered the long resistance, and
      successive resources, of the tyrant magnentius, might prepare
      themselves for the labors of three bloody campaigns. but the
      contest with his successor, who, like him, had usurped the throne
      of the west, was easily decided in the term of two months, 76 and
      within the space of two hundred miles. the superior genius of the
      emperor of the east might prevail over the feeble maximus, who,
      in this important crisis, showed himself destitute of military
      skill, or personal courage; but the abilities of theodosius were
      seconded by the advantage which he possessed of a numerous and
      active cavalry. the huns, the alani, and, after their example,
      the goths themselves, were formed into squadrons of archers; who
      fought on horseback, and confounded the steady valor of the gauls
      and germans, by the rapid motions of a tartar war. after the
      fatigue of a long march, in the heat of summer, they spurred
      their foaming horses into the waters of the save, swam the river
      in the presence of the enemy, and instantly charged and routed
      the troops who guarded the high ground on the opposite side.
      marcellinus, the tyrants brother, advanced to support them with
      the select cohorts, which were considered as the hope and
      strength of the army. the action, which had been interrupted by
      the approach of night, was renewed in the morning; and, after a
      sharp conflict, the surviving remnant of the bravest soldiers of
      maximus threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror.
      without suspending his march, to receive the loyal acclamations
      of the citizens of aemona, theodosius pressed forwards to
      terminate the war by the death or captivity of his rival, who
      fled before him with the diligence of fear. from the summit of
      the julian alps, he descended with such incredible speed into the
      plain of italy, that he reached aquileia on the evening of the
      first day; and maximus, who found himself encompassed on all
      sides, had scarcely time to shut the gates of the city. but the
      gates could not long resist the effort of a victorious enemy; and
      the despair, the disaffection, the indifference of the soldiers
      and people, hastened the downfall of the wretched maximus. he was
      dragged from his throne, rudely stripped of the imperial
      ornaments, the robe, the diadem, and the purple slippers; and
      conducted, like a malefactor, to the camp and presence of
      theodosius, at a place about three miles from aquileia. the
      behavior of the emperor was not intended to insult, and he showed
      disposition to pity and forgive, the tyrant of the west, who had
      never been his personal enemy, and was now become the object of
      his contempt. our sympathy is the most forcibly excited by the
      misfortunes to which we are exposed; and the spectacle of a proud
      competitor, now prostrate at his feet, could not fail of
      producing very serious and solemn thoughts in the mind of the
      victorious emperor. but the feeble emotion of involuntary pity
      was checked by his regard for public justice, and the memory of
      gratian; and he abandoned the victim to the pious zeal of the
      soldiers, who drew him out of the imperial presence, and
      instantly separated his head from his body. the intelligence of
      his defeat and death was received with sincere or well-dissembled
      joy: his son victor, on whom he had conferred the title of
      augustus, died by the order, perhaps by the hand, of the bold
      arbogastes; and all the military plans of theodosius were
      successfully executed. when he had thus terminated the civil war,
      with less difficulty and bloodshed than he might naturally
      expect, he employed the winter months of his residence at milan,
      to restore the state of the afflicted provinces; and early in the
      spring he made, after the example of constantine and constantius,
      his triumphal entry into the ancient capital of the roman empire.

      the orator, who may be silent without danger, may praise without
      difficulty, and without reluctance; 78 and posterity will
      confess, that the character of theodosius 79 might furnish the
      subject of a sincere and ample panegyric. the wisdom of his laws,
      and the success of his arms, rendered his administration
      respectable in the eyes both of his subjects and of his enemies.
      he loved and practised the virtues of domestic life, which seldom
      hold their residence in the palaces of kings. theodosius was
      chaste and temperate; he enjoyed, without excess, the sensual and
      social pleasures of the table; and the warmth of his amorous
      passions was never diverted from their lawful objects. the proud
      titles of imperial greatness were adorned by the tender names of
      a faithful husband, an indulgent father; his uncle was raised, by
      his affectionate esteem, to the rank of a second parent:
      theodosius embraced, as his own, the children of his brother and
      sister; and the expressions of his regard were extended to the
      most distant and obscure branches of his numerous kindred. his
      familiar friends were judiciously selected from among those
      persons, who, in the equal intercourse of private life, had
      appeared before his eyes without a mask; the consciousness of
      personal and superior merit enabled him to despise the accidental
      distinction of the purple; and he proved by his conduct, that he
      had forgotten all the injuries, while he most gratefully
      remembered all the favors and services, which he had received
      before he ascended the throne of the roman empire. the serious or
      lively tone of his conversation was adapted to the age, the rank,
      or the character of his subjects, whom he admitted into his
      society; and the affability of his manners displayed the image of
      his mind. theodosius respected the simplicity of the good and
      virtuous: every art, every talent, of a useful, or even of an
      innocent nature, was rewarded by his judicious liberality; and,
      except the heretics, whom he persecuted with implacable hatred,
      the diffusive circle of his benevolence was circumscribed only by
      the limits of the human race. the government of a mighty empire
      may assuredly suffice to occupy the time, and the abilities, of a
      mortal: yet the diligent prince, without aspiring to the
      unsuitable reputation of profound learning, always reserved some
      moments of his leisure for the instructive amusement of reading.
      history, which enlarged his experience, was his favorite study.
      the annals of rome, in the long period of eleven hundred years,
      presented him with a various and splendid picture of human life:
      and it has been particularly observed, that whenever he perused
      the cruel acts of cinna, of marius, or of sylla, he warmly
      expressed his generous detestation of those enemies of humanity
      and freedom. his disinterested opinion of past events was
      usefully applied as the rule of his own actions; and theodosius
      has deserved the singular commendation, that his virtues always
      seemed to expand with his fortune: the season of his prosperity
      was that of his moderation; and his clemency appeared the most
      conspicuous after the danger and success of a civil war. the
      moorish guards of the tyrant had been massacred in the first heat
      of the victory, and a small number of the most obnoxious
      criminals suffered the punishment of the law. but the emperor
      showed himself much more attentive to relieve the innocent than
      to chastise the guilty. the oppressed subjects of the west, who
      would have deemed themselves happy in the restoration of their
      lands, were astonished to receive a sum of money equivalent to
      their losses; and the liberality of the conqueror supported the
      aged mother, and educated the orphan daughters, of maximus. 80 a
      character thus accomplished might almost excuse the extravagant
      supposition of the orator pacatus; that, if the elder brutus
      could be permitted to revisit the earth, the stern republican
      would abjure, at the feet of theodosius, his hatred of kings; and
      ingenuously confess, that such a monarch was the most faithful
      guardian of the happiness and dignity of the roman people. 81

      yet the piercing eye of the founder of the republic must have
      discerned two essential imperfections, which might, perhaps, have
      abated his recent love of despostism. the virtuous mind of
      theodosius was often relaxed by indolence, 82 and it was
      sometimes inflamed by passion. 83 in the pursuit of an important
      object, his active courage was capable of the most vigorous
      exertions; but, as soon as the design was accomplished, or the
      danger was surmounted, the hero sunk into inglorious repose; and,
      forgetful that the time of a prince is the property of his
      people, resigned himself to the enjoyment of the innocent, but
      trifling, pleasures of a luxurious court. the natural disposition
      of theodosius was hasty and choleric; and, in a station where
      none could resist, and few would dissuade, the fatal consequence
      of his resentment, the humane monarch was justly alarmed by the
      consciousness of his infirmity and of his power. it was the
      constant study of his life to suppress, or regulate, the
      intemperate sallies of passion and the success of his efforts
      enhanced the merit of his clemency. but the painful virtue which
      claims the merit of victory, is exposed to the danger of defeat;
      and the reign of a wise and merciful prince was polluted by an
      act of cruelty which would stain the annals of nero or domitian.
      within the space of three years, the inconsistent historian of
      theodosius must relate the generous pardon of the citizens of
      antioch, and the inhuman massacre of the people of thessalonica.

      the lively impatience of the inhabitants of antioch was never
      satisfied with their own situation, or with the character and
      conduct of their successive sovereigns. the arian subjects of
      theodosius deplored the loss of their churches; and as three
      rival bishops disputed the throne of antioch, the sentence which
      decided their pretensions excited the murmurs of the two
      unsuccessful congregations. the exigencies of the gothic war, and
      the inevitable expense that accompanied the conclusion of the
      peace, had constrained the emperor to aggravate the weight of the
      public impositions; and the provinces of asia, as they had not
      been involved in the distress were the less inclined to
      contribute to the relief, of europe. the auspicious period now
      approached of the tenth year of his reign; a festival more
      grateful to the soldiers, who received a liberal donative, than
      to the subjects, whose voluntary offerings had been long since
      converted into an extraordinary and oppressive burden. the edicts
      of taxation interrupted the repose, and pleasures, of antioch;
      and the tribunal of the magistrate was besieged by a suppliant
      crowd; who, in pathetic, but, at first, in respectful language,
      solicited the redress of their grievances. they were gradually
      incensed by the pride of their haughty rulers, who treated their
      complaints as a criminal resistance; their satirical wit
      degenerated into sharp and angry invectives; and, from the
      subordinate powers of government, the invectives of the people
      insensibly rose to attack the sacred character of the emperor
      himself. their fury, provoked by a feeble opposition, discharged
      itself on the images of the imperial family, which were erected,
      as objects of public veneration, in the most conspicuous places
      of the city. the statues of theodosius, of his father, of his
      wife flaccilla, of his two sons, arcadius and honorius, were
      insolently thrown down from their pedestals, broken in pieces, or
      dragged with contempt through the streets; and the indignities
      which were offered to the representations of imperial majesty,
      sufficiently declared the impious and treasonable wishes of the
      populace. the tumult was almost immediately suppressed by the
      arrival of a body of archers: and antioch had leisure to reflect
      on the nature and consequences of her crime. 84 according to the
      duty of his office, the governor of the province despatched a
      faithful narrative of the whole transaction: while the trembling
      citizens intrusted the confession of their crime, and the
      assurances of their repentance, to the zeal of flavian, their
      bishop, and to the eloquence of the senator hilarius, the friend,
      and most probably the disciple, of libanius; whose genius, on
      this melancholy occasion, was not useless to his country. 85 but
      the two capitals, antioch and constantinople, were separated by
      the distance of eight hundred miles; and, notwithstanding the
      diligence of the imperial posts, the guilty city was severely
      punished by a long and dreadful interval of suspense. every rumor
      agitated the hopes and fears of the antiochians, and they heard
      with terror, that their sovereign, exasperated by the insult
      which had been offered to his own statues, and more especially,
      to those of his beloved wife, had resolved to level with the
      ground the offending city; and to massacre, without distinction
      of age or sex, the criminal inhabitants; 86 many of whom were
      actually driven, by their apprehensions, to seek a refuge in the
      mountains of syria, and the adjacent desert. at length,
      twenty-four days after the sedition, the general hellebicus and
      caesarius, master of the offices, declared the will of the
      emperor, and the sentence of antioch. that proud capital was
      degraded from the rank of a city; and the metropolis of the east,
      stripped of its lands, its privileges, and its revenues, was
      subjected, under the humiliating denomination of a village, to
      the jurisdiction of laodicea. 87 the baths, the circus, and the
      theatres were shut: and, that every source of plenty and pleasure
      might at the same time be intercepted, the distribution of corn
      was abolished, by the severe instructions of theodosius. his
      commissioners then proceeded to inquire into the guilt of
      individuals; of those who had perpetrated, and of those who had
      not prevented, the destruction of the sacred statues. the
      tribunal of hellebicus and caesarius, encompassed with armed
      soldiers, was erected in the midst of the forum. the noblest, and
      most wealthy, of the citizens of antioch appeared before them in
      chains; the examination was assisted by the use of torture, and
      their sentence was pronounced or suspended, according to the
      judgment of these extraordinary magistrates. the houses of the
      criminals were exposed to sale, their wives and children were
      suddenly reduced, from affluence and luxury, to the most abject
      distress; and a bloody execution was expected to conclude the
      horrors of the day, 88 which the preacher of antioch, the
      eloquent chrysostom, has represented as a lively image of the
      last and universal judgment of the world. but the ministers of
      theodosius performed, with reluctance, the cruel task which had
      been assigned them; they dropped a gentle tear over the
      calamities of the people; and they listened with reverence to the
      pressing solicitations of the monks and hermits, who descended in
      swarms from the mountains. 89 hellebicus and caesarius were
      persuaded to suspend the execution of their sentence; and it was
      agreed that the former should remain at antioch, while the latter
      returned, with all possible speed, to constantinople; and
      presumed once more to consult the will of his sovereign. the
      resentment of theodosius had already subsided; the deputies of
      the people, both the bishop and the orator, had obtained a
      favorable audience; and the reproaches of the emperor were the
      complaints of injured friendship, rather than the stern menaces
      of pride and power. a free and general pardon was granted to the
      city and citizens of antioch; the prison doors were thrown open;
      the senators, who despaired of their lives, recovered the
      possession of their houses and estates; and the capital of the
      east was restored to the enjoyment of her ancient dignity and
      splendor. theodosius condescended to praise the senate of
      constantinople, who had generously interceded for their
      distressed brethren: he rewarded the eloquence of hilarius with
      the government of palestine; and dismissed the bishop of antioch
      with the warmest expressions of his respect and gratitude. a
      thousand new statues arose to the clemency of theodosius; the
      applause of his subjects was ratified by the approbation of his
      own heart; and the emperor confessed, that, if the exercise of
      justice is the most important duty, the indulgence of mercy is
      the most exquisite pleasure, of a sovereign. 90

      the sedition of thessalonica is ascribed to a more shameful
      cause, and was productive of much more dreadful consequences.
      that great city, the metropolis of all the illyrian provinces,
      had been protected from the dangers of the gothic war by strong
      fortifications and a numerous garrison. botheric, the general of
      those troops, and, as it should seem from his name, a barbarian,
      had among his slaves a beautiful boy, who excited the impure
      desires of one of the charioteers of the circus. the insolent and
      brutal lover was thrown into prison by the order of botheric; and
      he sternly rejected the importunate clamors of the multitude,
      who, on the day of the public games, lamented the absence of
      their favorite; and considered the skill of a charioteer as an
      object of more importance than his virtue. the resentment of the
      people was imbittered by some previous disputes; and, as the
      strength of the garrison had been drawn away for the service of
      the italian war, the feeble remnant, whose numbers were reduced
      by desertion, could not save the unhappy general from their
      licentious fury. botheric, and several of his principal officers,
      were inhumanly murdered; their mangled bodies were dragged about
      the streets; and the emperor, who then resided at milan, was
      surprised by the intelligence of the audacious and wanton cruelty
      of the people of thessalonica. the sentence of a dispassionate
      judge would have inflicted a severe punishment on the authors of
      the crime; and the merit of botheric might contribute to
      exasperate the grief and indignation of his master.

      the fiery and choleric temper of theodosius was impatient of the
      dilatory forms of a judicial inquiry; and he hastily resolved,
      that the blood of his lieutenant should be expiated by the blood
      of the guilty people. yet his mind still fluctuated between the
      counsels of clemency and of revenge; the zeal of the bishops had
      almost extorted from the reluctant emperor the promise of a
      general pardon; his passion was again inflamed by the flattering
      suggestions of his minister rufinus; and, after theodosius had
      despatched the messengers of death, he attempted, when it was too
      late, to prevent the execution of his orders. the punishment of a
      roman city was blindly committed to the undistinguishing sword of
      the barbarians; and the hostile preparations were concerted with
      the dark and perfidious artifice of an illegal conspiracy. the
      people of thessalonica were treacherously invited, in the name of
      their sovereign, to the games of the circus; and such was their
      insatiate avidity for those amusements, that every consideration
      of fear, or suspicion, was disregarded by the numerous
      spectators. as soon as the assembly was complete, the soldiers,
      who had secretly been posted round the circus, received the
      signal, not of the races, but of a general massacre. the
      promiscuous carnage continued three hours, without discrimination
      of strangers or natives, of age or sex, of innocence or guilt;
      the most moderate accounts state the number of the slain at seven
      thousand; and it is affirmed by some writers that more than
      fifteen thousand victims were sacrificed to the names of
      botheric. a foreign merchant, who had probably no concern in his
      murder, offered his own life, and all his wealth, to supply the
      place of one of his two sons; but, while the father hesitated
      with equal tenderness, while he was doubtful to choose, and
      unwilling to condemn, the soldiers determined his suspense, by
      plunging their daggers at the same moment into the breasts of the
      defenceless youths. the apology of the assassins, that they were
      obliged to produce the prescribed number of heads, serves only to
      increase, by an appearance of order and design, the horrors of
      the massacre, which was executed by the commands of theodosius.
      the guilt of the emperor is aggravated by his long and frequent
      residence at thessalonica. the situation of the unfortunate city,
      the aspect of the streets and buildings, the dress and faces of
      the inhabitants, were familiar, and even present, to his
      imagination; and theodosius possessed a quick and lively sense of
      the existence of the people whom he destroyed. 91

      enemy of theodosius, most unaccountably passes over in silence
      the worst of his actions.]

      the respectful attachment of the emperor for the orthodox clergy,
      had disposed him to love and admire the character of ambrose; who
      united all the episcopal virtues in the most eminent degree. the
      friends and ministers of theodosius imitated the example of their
      sovereign; and he observed, with more surprise than displeasure,
      that all his secret counsels were immediately communicated to the
      archbishop; who acted from the laudable persuasion, that every
      measure of civil government may have some connection with the
      glory of god, and the interest of the true religion. the monks
      and populace of callinicum, 9111 an obscure town on the frontier
      of persia, excited by their own fanaticism, and by that of their
      bishop, had tumultuously burnt a conventicle of the valentinians,
      and a synagogue of the jews. the seditious prelate was condemned,
      by the magistrate of the province, either to rebuild the
      synagogue, or to repay the damage; and this moderate sentence was
      confirmed by the emperor. but it was not confirmed by the
      archbishop of milan. 92 he dictated an epistle of censure and
      reproach, more suitable, perhaps, if the emperor had received the
      mark of circumcision, and renounced the faith of his baptism.
      ambrose considers the toleration of the jewish, as the
      persecution of the christian, religion; boldly declares that he
      himself, and every true believer, would eagerly dispute with the
      bishop of callinicum the merit of the deed, and the crown of
      martyrdom; and laments, in the most pathetic terms, that the
      execution of the sentence would be fatal to the fame and
      salvation of theodosius. as this private admonition did not
      produce an immediate effect, the archbishop, from his pulpit, 93
      publicly addressed the emperor on his throne; 94 nor would he
      consent to offer the oblation of the altar, till he had obtained
      from theodosius a solemn and positive declaration, which secured
      the impunity of the bishop and monks of callinicum. the
      recantation of theodosius was sincere; 95 and, during the term of
      his residence at milan, his affection for ambrose was continually
      increased by the habits of pious and familiar conversation.

      when ambrose was informed of the massacre of thessalonica, his
      mind was filled with horror and anguish. he retired into the
      country to indulge his grief, and to avoid the presence of
      theodosius. but as the archbishop was satisfied that a timid
      silence would render him the accomplice of his guilt, he
      represented, in a private letter, the enormity of the crime;
      which could only be effaced by the tears of penitence. the
      episcopal vigor of ambrose was tempered by prudence; and he
      contented himself with signifying 96 an indirect sort of
      excommunication, by the assurance, that he had been warned in a
      vision not to offer the oblation in the name, or in the presence,
      of theodosius; and by the advice, that he would confine himself
      to the use of prayer, without presuming to approach the altar of
      christ, or to receive the holy eucharist with those hands that
      were still polluted with the blood of an innocent people. the
      emperor was deeply affected by his own reproaches, and by those
      of his spiritual father; and after he had bewailed the
      mischievous and irreparable consequences of his rash fury, he
      proceeded, in the accustomed manner, to perform his devotions in
      the great church of milan. he was stopped in the porch by the
      archbishop; who, in the tone and language of an ambassador of
      heaven, declared to his sovereign, that private contrition was
      not sufficient to atone for a public fault, or to appease the
      justice of the offended deity. theodosius humbly represented,
      that if he had contracted the guilt of homicide, david, the man
      after gods own heart, had been guilty, not only of murder, but
      of adultery. you have imitated david in his crime, imitate then
      his repentance, was the reply of the undaunted ambrose. the
      rigorous conditions of peace and pardon were accepted; and the
      public penance of the emperor theodosius has been recorded as one
      of the most honorable events in the annals of the church.
      according to the mildest rules of ecclesiastical discipline,
      which were established in the fourth century, the crime of
      homicide was expiated by the penitence of twenty years: 97 and as
      it was impossible, in the period of human life, to purge the
      accumulated guilt of the massacre of thessalonica, the murderer
      should have been excluded from the holy communion till the hour
      of his death. but the archbishop, consulting the maxims of
      religious policy, granted some indulgence to the rank of his
      illustrious penitent, who humbled in the dust the pride of the
      diadem; and the public edification might be admitted as a weighty
      reason to abridge the duration of his punishment. it was
      sufficient, that the emperor of the romans, stripped of the
      ensigns of royalty, should appear in a mournful and suppliant
      posture; and that, in the midst of the church of milan, he should
      humbly solicit, with sighs and tears, the pardon of his sins. 98
      in this spiritual cure, ambrose employed the various methods of
      mildness and severity. after a delay of about eight months,
      theodosius was restored to the communion of the faithful; and the
      edict which interposes a salutary interval of thirty days between
      the sentence and the execution, may be accepted as the worthy
      fruits of his repentance. 99 posterity has applauded the virtuous
      firmness of the archbishop; and the example of theodosius may
      prove the beneficial influence of those principles, which could
      force a monarch, exalted above the apprehension of human
      punishment, to respect the laws, and ministers, of an invisible
      judge. the prince, says montesquieu, who is actuated by the
      hopes and fears of religion, may be compared to a lion, docile
      only to the voice, and tractable to the hand, of his keeper. 100
      the motions of the royal animal will therefore depend on the
      inclination, and interest, of the man who has acquired such
      dangerous authority over him; and the priest, who holds in his
      hands the conscience of a king, may inflame, or moderate, his
      sanguinary passions. the cause of humanity, and that of
      persecution, have been asserted, by the same ambrose, with equal
      energy, and with equal success.

      chapter xxvii: civil wars, reign of theodosius.part v.

      after the defeat and death of the tyrant of gaul, the roman world
      was in the possession of theodosius. he derived from the choice
      of gratian his honorable title to the provinces of the east: he
      had acquired the west by the right of conquest; and the three
      years which he spent in italy were usefully employed to restore
      the authority of the laws, and to correct the abuses which had
      prevailed with impunity under the usurpation of maximus, and the
      minority of valentinian. the name of valentinian was regularly
      inserted in the public acts: but the tender age, and doubtful
      faith, of the son of justina, appeared to require the prudent
      care of an orthodox guardian; and his specious ambition might
      have excluded the unfortunate youth, without a struggle, and
      almost without a murmur, from the administration, and even from
      the inheritance, of the empire. if theodosius had consulted the
      rigid maxims of interest and policy, his conduct would have been
      justified by his friends; but the generosity of his behavior on
      this memorable occasion has extorted the applause of his most
      inveterate enemies. he seated valentinian on the throne of milan;
      and, without stipulating any present or future advantages,
      restored him to the absolute dominion of all the provinces, from
      which he had been driven by the arms of maximus. to the
      restitution of his ample patrimony, theodosius added the free and
      generous gift of the countries beyond the alps, which his
      successful valor had recovered from the assassin of gratian. 101
      satisfied with the glory which he had acquired, by revenging the
      death of his benefactor, and delivering the west from the yoke of
      tyranny, the emperor returned from milan to constantinople; and,
      in the peaceful possession of the east, insensibly relapsed into
      his former habits of luxury and indolence. theodosius discharged
      his obligation to the brother, he indulged his conjugal
      tenderness to the sister, of valentinian; and posterity, which
      admires the pure and singular glory of his elevation, must
      applaud his unrivalled generosity in the use of victory.

      101 (return) [ it is the niggard praise of zosimus himself, (l.
      iv. p. 267.) augustin says, with some happiness of expression,
      valentinianum.... misericordissima veneratione restituit.]

      the empress justina did not long survive her return to italy;
      and, though she beheld the triumph of theodosius, she was not
      allowed to influence the government of her son. 102 the
      pernicious attachment to the arian sect, which valentinian had
      imbibed from her example and instructions, was soon erased by the
      lessons of a more orthodox education. his growing zeal for the
      faith of nice, and his filial reverence for the character and
      authority of ambrose, disposed the catholics to entertain the
      most favorable opinion of the virtues of the young emperor of the
      west. 103 they applauded his chastity and temperance, his
      contempt of pleasure, his application to business, and his tender
      affection for his two sisters; which could not, however, seduce
      his impartial equity to pronounce an unjust sentence against the
      meanest of his subjects. but this amiable youth, before he had
      accomplished the twentieth year of his age, was oppressed by
      domestic treason; and the empire was again involved in the
      horrors of a civil war. arbogastes, 104 a gallant soldier of the
      nation of the franks, held the second rank in the service of
      gratian. on the death of his master he joined the standard of
      theodosius; contributed, by his valor and military conduct, to
      the destruction of the tyrant; and was appointed, after the
      victory, master-general of the armies of gaul. his real merit,
      and apparent fidelity, had gained the confidence both of the
      prince and people; his boundless liberality corrupted the
      allegiance of the troops; and, whilst he was universally esteemed
      as the pillar of the state, the bold and crafty barbarian was
      secretly determined either to rule, or to ruin, the empire of the
      west. the important commands of the army were distributed among
      the franks; the creatures of arbogastes were promoted to all the
      honors and offices of the civil government; the progress of the
      conspiracy removed every faithful servant from the presence of
      valentinian; and the emperor, without power and without
      intelligence, insensibly sunk into the precarious and dependent
      condition of a captive. 105 the indignation which he expressed,
      though it might arise only from the rash and impatient temper of
      youth, may be candidly ascribed to the generous spirit of a
      prince, who felt that he was not unworthy to reign. he secretly
      invited the archbishop of milan to undertake the office of a
      mediator; as the pledge of his sincerity, and the guardian of his
      safety. he contrived to apprise the emperor of the east of his
      helpless situation, and he declared, that, unless theodosius
      could speedily march to his assistance, he must attempt to escape
      from the palace, or rather prison, of vienna in gaul, where he
      had imprudently fixed his residence in the midst of the hostile
      faction. but the hopes of relief were distant, and doubtful: and,
      as every day furnished some new provocation, the emperor, without
      strength or counsel, too hastily resolved to risk an immediate
      contest with his powerful general. he received arbogastes on the
      throne; and, as the count approached with some appearance of
      respect, delivered to him a paper, which dismissed him from all
      his employments. my authority, replied arbogastes, with
      insulting coolness, does not depend on the smile or the frown of
      a monarch; and he contemptuously threw the paper on the ground.
      the indignant monarch snatched at the sword of one of the guards,
      which he struggled to draw from its scabbard; and it was not
      without some degree of violence that he was prevented from using
      the deadly weapon against his enemy, or against himself. a few
      days after this extraordinary quarrel, in which he had exposed
      his resentment and his weakness, the unfortunate valentinian was
      found strangled in his apartment; and some pains were employed to
      disguise the manifest guilt of arbogastes, and to persuade the
      world, that the death of the young emperor had been the voluntary
      effect of his own despair. 106 his body was conducted with decent
      pomp to the sepulchre of milan; and the archbishop pronounced a
      funeral oration to commemorate his virtues and his misfortunes.
      107 on this occasion the humanity of ambrose tempted him to make
      a singular breach in his theological system; and to comfort the
      weeping sisters of valentinian, by the firm assurance, that their
      pious brother, though he had not received the sacrament of
      baptism, was introduced, without difficulty, into the mansions of
      eternal bliss. 108

      frank might place on the imperial throne. but some remains of
      pride and prejudice still opposed the elevation of arbogastes
      himself; and the judicious barbarian thought it more advisable to
      reign under the name of some dependent roman. he bestowed the
      purple on the rhetorician eugenius; 109 whom he had already
      raised from the place of his domestic secretary to the rank of
      master of the offices. in the course, both of his private and
      public service, the count had always approved the attachment and
      abilities of eugenius; his learning and eloquence, supported by
      the gravity of his manners, recommended him to the esteem of the
      people; and the reluctance with which he seemed to ascend the
      throne, may inspire a favorable prejudice of his virtue and
      moderation. the ambassadors of the new emperor were immediately
      despatched to the court of theodosius, to communicate, with
      affected grief, the unfortunate accident of the death of
      valentinian; and, without mentioning the name of arbogastes, to
      request, that the monarch of the east would embrace, as his
      lawful colleague, the respectable citizen, who had obtained the
      unanimous suffrage of the armies and provinces of the west. 110
      theodosius was justly provoked, that the perfidy of a barbarian,
      should have destroyed, in a moment, the labors, and the fruit, of
      his former victory; and he was excited by the tears of his
      beloved wife, 111 to revenge the fate of her unhappy brother, and
      once more to assert by arms the violated majesty of the throne.
      but as the second conquest of the west was a task of difficulty
      and danger, he dismissed, with splendid presents, and an
      ambiguous answer, the ambassadors of eugenius; and almost two
      years were consumed in the preparations of the civil war. before
      he formed any decisive resolution, the pious emperor was anxious
      to discover the will of heaven; and as the progress of
      christianity had silenced the oracles of delphi and dodona, he
      consulted an egyptian monk, who possessed, in the opinion of the
      age, the gift of miracles, and the knowledge of futurity.
      eutropius, one of the favorite eunuchs of the palace of
      constantinople, embarked for alexandria, from whence he sailed up
      the nile, as far as the city of lycopolis, or of wolves, in the
      remote province of thebais. 112 in the neighborhood of that city,
      and on the summit of a lofty mountain, the holy john 113 had
      constructed, with his own hands, an humble cell, in which he had
      dwelt above fifty years, without opening his door, without seeing
      the face of a woman, and without tasting any food that had been
      prepared by fire, or any human art. five days of the week he
      spent in prayer and meditation; but on saturdays and sundays he
      regularly opened a small window, and gave audience to the crowd
      of suppliants who successively flowed from every part of the
      christian world. the eunuch of theodosius approached the window
      with respectful steps, proposed his questions concerning the
      event of the civil war, and soon returned with a favorable
      oracle, which animated the courage of the emperor by the
      assurance of a bloody, but infallible victory. 114 the
      accomplishment of the prediction was forwarded by all the means
      that human prudence could supply. the industry of the two
      master-generals, stilicho and timasius, was directed to recruit
      the numbers, and to revive the discipline of the roman legions.
      the formidable troops of barbarians marched under the ensigns of
      their national chieftains. the iberian, the arab, and the goth,
      who gazed on each other with mutual astonishment, were enlisted
      in the service of the same prince; 1141 and the renowned alaric
      acquired, in the school of theodosius, the knowledge of the art
      of war, which he afterwards so fatally exerted for the
      destruction of rome. 115

      the emperor of the west, or, to speak more properly, his general
      arbogastes, was instructed by the misconduct and misfortune of
      maximus, how dangerous it might prove to extend the line of
      defence against a skilful antagonist, who was free to press, or
      to suspend, to contract, or to multiply, his various methods of
      attack. 116 arbogastes fixed his station on the confines of
      italy; the troops of theodosius were permitted to occupy, without
      resistance, the provinces of pannonia, as far as the foot of the
      julian alps; and even the passes of the mountains were
      negligently, or perhaps artfully, abandoned to the bold invader.
      he descended from the hills, and beheld, with some astonishment,
      the formidable camp of the gauls and germans, that covered with
      arms and tents the open country which extends to the walls of
      aquileia, and the banks of the frigidus, 117 or cold river. 118
      this narrow theatre of the war, circumscribed by the alps and the
      adriatic, did not allow much room for the operations of military
      skill; the spirit of arbogastes would have disdained a pardon;
      his guilt extinguished the hope of a negotiation; and theodosius
      was impatient to satisfy his glory and revenge, by the
      chastisement of the assassins of valentinian. without weighing
      the natural and artificial obstacles that opposed his efforts,
      the emperor of the east immediately attacked the fortifications
      of his rivals, assigned the post of honorable danger to the
      goths, and cherished a secret wish, that the bloody conflict
      might diminish the pride and numbers of the conquerors. ten
      thousand of those auxiliaries, and bacurius, general of the
      iberians, died bravely on the field of battle. but the victory
      was not purchased by their blood; the gauls maintained their
      advantage; and the approach of night protected the disorderly
      flight, or retreat, of the troops of theodosius. the emperor
      retired to the adjacent hills; where he passed a disconsolate
      night, without sleep, without provisions, and without hopes; 119
      except that strong assurance, which, under the most desperate
      circumstances, the independent mind may derive from the contempt
      of fortune and of life. the triumph of eugenius was celebrated by
      the insolent and dissolute joy of his camp; whilst the active and
      vigilant arbogastes secretly detached a considerable body of
      troops to occupy the passes of the mountains, and to encompass
      the rear of the eastern army. the dawn of day discovered to the
      eyes of theodosius the extent and the extremity of his danger;
      but his apprehensions were soon dispelled, by a friendly message
      from the leaders of those troops who expressed their inclination
      to desert the standard of the tyrant. the honorable and lucrative
      rewards, which they stipulated as the price of their perfidy,
      were granted without hesitation; and as ink and paper could not
      easily be procured, the emperor subscribed, on his own tablets,
      the ratification of the treaty. the spirit of his soldiers was
      revived by this seasonable reenforcement; and they again marched,
      with confidence, to surprise the camp of a tyrant, whose
      principal officers appeared to distrust, either the justice or
      the success of his arms. in the heat of the battle, a violent
      tempest, 120 such as is often felt among the alps, suddenly arose
      from the east. the army of theodosius was sheltered by their
      position from the impetuosity of the wind, which blew a cloud of
      dust in the faces of the enemy, disordered their ranks, wrested
      their weapons from their hands, and diverted, or repelled, their
      ineffectual javelins. this accidental advantage was skilfully
      improved, the violence of the storm was magnified by the
      superstitious terrors of the gauls; and they yielded without
      shame to the invisible powers of heaven, who seemed to militate
      on the side of the pious emperor. his victory was decisive; and
      the deaths of his two rivals were distinguished only by the
      difference of their characters. the rhetorician eugenius, who had
      almost acquired the dominion of the world, was reduced to implore
      the mercy of the conqueror; and the unrelenting soldiers
      separated his head from his body as he lay prostrate at the feet
      of theodosius. arbogastes, after the loss of a battle, in which
      he had discharged the duties of a soldier and a general, wandered
      several days among the mountains. but when he was convinced that
      his cause was desperate, and his escape impracticable, the
      intrepid barbarian imitated the example of the ancient romans,
      and turned his sword against his own breast. the fate of the
      empire was determined in a narrow corner of italy; and the
      legitimate successor of the house of valentinian embraced the
      archbishop of milan, and graciously received the submission of
      the provinces of the west. those provinces were involved in the
      guilt of rebellion; while the inflexible courage of ambrose alone
      had resisted the claims of successful usurpation. with a manly
      freedom, which might have been fatal to any other subject, the
      archbishop rejected the gifts of eugenius, 1201 declined his
      correspondence, and withdrew himself from milan, to avoid the
      odious presence of a tyrant, whose downfall he predicted in
      discreet and ambiguous language. the merit of ambrose was
      applauded by the conqueror, who secured the attachment of the
      people by his alliance with the church; and the clemency of
      theodosius is ascribed to the humane intercession of the
      archbishop of milan. 121

      after the defeat of eugenius, the merit, as well as the
      authority, of theodosius was cheerfully acknowledged by all the
      inhabitants of the roman world. the experience of his past
      conduct encouraged the most pleasing expectations of his future
      reign; and the age of the emperor, which did not exceed fifty
      years, seemed to extend the prospect of the public felicity. his
      death, only four months after his victory, was considered by the
      people as an unforeseen and fatal event, which destroyed, in a
      moment, the hopes of the rising generation. but the indulgence of
      ease and luxury had secretly nourished the principles of disease.
      122 the strength of theodosius was unable to support the sudden
      and violent transition from the palace to the camp; and the
      increasing symptoms of a dropsy announced the speedy dissolution
      of the emperor. the opinion, and perhaps the interest, of the
      public had confirmed the division of the eastern and western
      empires; and the two royal youths, arcadius and honorius, who had
      already obtained, from the tenderness of their father, the title
      of augustus, were destined to fill the thrones of constantinople
      and of rome. those princes were not permitted to share the danger
      and glory of the civil war; 123 but as soon as theodosius had
      triumphed over his unworthy rivals, he called his younger son,
      honorius, to enjoy the fruits of the victory, and to receive the
      sceptre of the west from the hands of his dying father. the
      arrival of honorius at milan was welcomed by a splendid
      exhibition of the games of the circus; and the emperor, though he
      was oppressed by the weight of his disorder, contributed by his
      presence to the public joy. but the remains of his strength were
      exhausted by the painful effort which he made to assist at the
      spectacles of the morning. honorius supplied, during the rest of
      the day, the place of his father; and the great theodosius
      expired in the ensuing night. notwithstanding the recent
      animosities of a civil war, his death was universally lamented.
      the barbarians, whom he had vanquished and the churchmen, by whom
      he had been subdued, celebrated, with loud and sincere applause,
      the qualities of the deceased emperor, which appeared the most
      valuable in their eyes. the romans were terrified by the
      impending dangers of a feeble and divided administration, and
      every disgraceful moment of the unfortunate reigns of arcadius
      and honorius revived the memory of their irreparable loss.

      and the journey of honorius, after the victory (claudian in iii.
      cons. 78-125.)]

      in the faithful picture of the virtues of theodosius, his
      imperfections have not been dissembled; the act of cruelty, and
      the habits of indolence, which tarnished the glory of one of the
      greatest of the roman princes. an historian, perpetually adverse
      to the fame of theodosius, has exaggerated his vices, and their
      pernicious effects; he boldly asserts, that every rank of
      subjects imitated the effeminate manners of their sovereign; and
      that every species of corruption polluted the course of public
      and private life; and that the feeble restraints of order and
      decency were insufficient to resist the progress of that
      degenerate spirit, which sacrifices, without a blush, the
      consideration of duty and interest to the base indulgence of
      sloth and appetite. 124 the complaints of contemporary writers,
      who deplore the increase of luxury, and depravation of manners,
      are commonly expressive of their peculiar temper and situation.
      there are few observers, who possess a clear and comprehensive
      view of the revolutions of society; and who are capable of
      discovering the nice and secret springs of action, which impel,
      in the same uniform direction, the blind and capricious passions
      of a multitude of individuals. if it can be affirmed, with any
      degree of truth, that the luxury of the romans was more shameless
      and dissolute in the reign of theodosius than in the age of
      constantine, perhaps, or of augustus, the alteration cannot be
      ascribed to any beneficial improvements, which had gradually
      increased the stock of national riches. a long period of calamity
      or decay must have checked the industry, and diminished the
      wealth, of the people; and their profuse luxury must have been
      the result of that indolent despair, which enjoys the present
      hour, and declines the thoughts of futurity. the uncertain
      condition of their property discouraged the subjects of
      theodosius from engaging in those useful and laborious
      undertakings which require an immediate expense, and promise a
      slow and distant advantage. the frequent examples of ruin and
      desolation tempted them not to spare the remains of a patrimony,
      which might, every hour, become the prey of the rapacious goth.
      and the mad prodigality which prevails in the confusion of a
      shipwreck, or a siege, may serve to explain the progress of
      luxury amidst the misfortunes and terrors of a sinking nation.

      124 (return) [ zosimus, l. iv. p. 244.]

      the effeminate luxury, which infected the manners of courts and
      cities, had instilled a secret and destructive poison into the
      camps of the legions; and their degeneracy has been marked by the
      pen of a military writer, who had accurately studied the genuine
      and ancient principles of roman discipline. it is the just and
      important observation of vegetius, that the infantry was
      invariably covered with defensive armor, from the foundation of
      the city, to the reign of the emperor gratian. the relaxation of
      discipline, and the disuse of exercise, rendered the soldiers
      less able, and less willing, to support the fatigues of the
      service; they complained of the weight of the armor, which they
      seldom wore; and they successively obtained the permission of
      laying aside both their cuirasses and their helmets. the heavy
      weapons of their ancestors, the short sword, and the formidable
      pilum, which had subdued the world, insensibly dropped from their
      feeble hands. as the use of the shield is incompatible with that
      of the bow, they reluctantly marched into the field; condemned to
      suffer either the pain of wounds, or the ignominy of flight, and
      always disposed to prefer the more shameful alternative. the
      cavalry of the goths, the huns, and the alani, had felt the
      benefits, and adopted the use, of defensive armor; and, as they
      excelled in the management of missile weapons, they easily
      overwhelmed the naked and trembling legions, whose heads and
      breasts were exposed, without defence, to the arrows of the
      barbarians. the loss of armies, the destruction of cities, and
      the dishonor of the roman name, ineffectually solicited the
      successors of gratian to restore the helmets and the cuirasses of
      the infantry. the enervated soldiers abandoned their own and the
      public defence; and their pusillanimous indolence may be
      considered as the immediate cause of the downfall of the empire.

      chapter xxviii: destruction of paganism.part i.

     final destruction of paganism.introduction of the worship of
     saints, and relics, among the christians.

      the ruin of paganism, in the age of theodosius, is perhaps the
      only example of the total extirpation of any ancient and popular
      superstition; and may therefore deserve to be considered as a
      singular event in the history of the human mind. the christians,
      more especially the clergy, had impatiently supported the prudent
      delays of constantine, and the equal toleration of the elder
      valentinian; nor could they deem their conquest perfect or
      secure, as long as their adversaries were permitted to exist. the
      influence which ambrose and his brethren had acquired over the
      youth of gratian, and the piety of theodosius, was employed to
      infuse the maxims of persecution into the breasts of their
      imperial proselytes. two specious principles of religious
      jurisprudence were established, from whence they deduced a direct
      and rigorous conclusion, against the subjects of the empire who
      still adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors: that the
      magistrate is, in some measure, guilty of the crimes which he
      neglects to prohibit, or to punish; and, that the idolatrous
      worship of fabulous deities, and real daemons, is the most
      abominable crime against the supreme majesty of the creator. the
      laws of moses, and the examples of jewish history, 1 were
      hastily, perhaps erroneously, applied, by the clergy, to the mild
      and universal reign of christianity. 2 the zeal of the emperors
      was excited to vindicate their own honor, and that of the deity:
      and the temples of the roman world were subverted, about sixty
      years after the conversion of constantine.

      from the age of numa to the reign of gratian, the romans
      preserved the regular succession of the several colleges of the
      sacerdotal order. 3 fifteen pontiffs exercised their supreme
      jurisdiction over all things, and persons, that were consecrated
      to the service of the gods; and the various questions which
      perpetually arose in a loose and traditionary system, were
      submitted to the judgment of their holy tribunal. fifteen grave
      and learned augurs observed the face of the heavens, and
      prescribed the actions of heroes, according to the flight of
      birds. fifteen keepers of the sibylline books (their name of
      quindecemvirs was derived from their number) occasionally
      consulted the history of future, and, as it should seem, of
      contingent, events. six vestals devoted their virginity to the
      guard of the sacred fire, and of the unknown pledges of the
      duration of rome; which no mortal had been suffered to behold
      with impunity. 4 seven epulos prepared the table of the gods,
      conducted the solemn procession, and regulated the ceremonies of
      the annual festival. the three flamens of jupiter, of mars, and
      of quirinus, were considered as the peculiar ministers of the
      three most powerful deities, who watched over the fate of rome
      and of the universe. the king of the sacrifices represented the
      person of numa, and of his successors, in the religious
      functions, which could be performed only by royal hands. the
      confraternities of the salians, the lupercals, &c., practised
      such rites as might extort a smile of contempt from every
      reasonable man, with a lively confidence of recommending
      themselves to the favor of the immortal gods. the authority,
      which the roman priests had formerly obtained in the counsels of
      the republic, was gradually abolished by the establishment of
      monarchy, and the removal of the seat of empire. but the dignity
      of their sacred character was still protected by the laws, and
      manners of their country; and they still continued, more
      especially the college of pontiffs, to exercise in the capital,
      and sometimes in the provinces, the rights of their
      ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction. their robes of purple,
      chariotz of state, and sumptuous entertainments, attracted the
      admiration of the people; and they received, from the consecrated
      lands, and the public revenue, an ample stipend, which liberally
      supported the splendor of the priesthood, and all the expenses of
      the religious worship of the state. as the service of the altar
      was not incompatible with the command of armies, the romans,
      after their consulships and triumphs, aspired to the place of
      pontiff, or of augur; the seats of cicero 5 and pompey were
      filled, in the fourth century, by the most illustrious members of
      the senate; and the dignity of their birth reflected additional
      splendor on their sacerdotal character. the fifteen priests, who
      composed the college of pontiffs, enjoyed a more distinguished
      rank as the companions of their sovereign; and the christian
      emperors condescended to accept the robe and ensigns, which were
      appropriated to the office of supreme pontiff. but when gratian
      ascended the throne, more scrupulous or more enlightened, he
      sternly rejected those profane symbols; 6 applied to the service
      of the state, or of the church, the revenues of the priests and
      vestals; abolished their honors and immunities; and dissolved the
      ancient fabric of roman superstition, which was supported by the
      opinions and habits of eleven hundred years. paganism was still
      the constitutional religion of the senate. the hall, or temple,
      in which they assembled, was adorned by the statue and altar of
      victory; 7 a majestic female standing on a globe, with flowing
      garments, expanded wings, and a crown of laurel in her
      outstretched hand. 8 the senators were sworn on the altar of the
      goddess to observe the laws of the emperor and of the empire: and
      a solemn offering of wine and incense was the ordinary prelude of
      their public deliberations. 9 the removal of this ancient
      monument was the only injury which constantius had offered to the
      superstition of the romans. the altar of victory was again
      restored by julian, tolerated by valentinian, and once more
      banished from the senate by the zeal of gratian. 10 but the
      emperor yet spared the statues of the gods which were exposed to
      the public veneration: four hundred and twenty-four temples, or
      chapels, still remained to satisfy the devotion of the people;
      and in every quarter of rome the delicacy of the christians was
      offended by the fumes of idolatrous sacrifice. 11

      but the christians formed the least numerous party in the senate
      of rome: 12 and it was only by their absence, that they could
      express their dissent from the legal, though profane, acts of a
      pagan majority. in that assembly, the dying embers of freedom
      were, for a moment, revived and inflamed by the breath of
      fanaticism. four respectable deputations were successively voted
      to the imperial court, 13 to represent the grievances of the
      priesthood and the senate, and to solicit the restoration of the
      altar of victory. the conduct of this important business was
      intrusted to the eloquent symmachus, 14 a wealthy and noble
      senator, who united the sacred characters of pontiff and augur
      with the civil dignities of proconsul of africa and prfect of
      the city. the breast of symmachus was animated by the warmest
      zeal for the cause of expiring paganism; and his religious
      antagonists lamented the abuse of his genius, and the inefficacy
      of his moral virtues. 15 the orator, whose petition is extant to
      the emperor valentinian, was conscious of the difficulty and
      danger of the office which he had assumed. he cautiously avoids
      every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his
      sovereign; humbly declares, that prayers and entreaties are his
      only arms; and artfully draws his arguments from the schools of
      rhetoric, rather than from those of philosophy. symmachus
      endeavors to seduce the imagination of a young prince, by
      displaying the attributes of the goddess of victory; he
      insinuates, that the confiscation of the revenues, which were
      consecrated to the service of the gods, was a measure unworthy of
      his liberal and disinterested character; and he maintains, that
      the roman sacrifices would be deprived of their force and energy,
      if they were no longer celebrated at the expense, as well as in
      the name, of the republic. even scepticism is made to supply an
      apology for superstition. the great and incomprehensible secret
      of the universe eludes the inquiry of man. where reason cannot
      instruct, custom may be permitted to guide; and every nation
      seems to consult the dictates of prudence, by a faithful
      attachment to those rites and opinions, which have received the
      sanction of ages. if those ages have been crowned with glory and
      prosperity, if the devout people have frequently obtained the
      blessings which they have solicited at the altars of the gods, it
      must appear still more advisable to persist in the same salutary
      practice; and not to risk the unknown perils that may attend any
      rash innovations. the test of antiquity and success was applied
      with singular advantage to the religion of numa; and rome
      herself, the celestial genius that presided over the fates of the
      city, is introduced by the orator to plead her own cause before
      the tribunal of the emperors. most excellent princes, says the
      venerable matron, fathers of your country! pity and respect my
      age, which has hitherto flowed in an uninterrupted course of
      piety. since i do not repent, permit me to continue in the
      practice of my ancient rites. since i am born free, allow me to
      enjoy my domestic institutions. this religion has reduced the
      world under my laws. these rites have repelled hannibal from the
      city, and the gauls from the capitol. were my gray hairs reserved
      for such intolerable disgrace? i am ignorant of the new system
      that i am required to adopt; but i am well assured, that the
      correction of old age is always an ungrateful and ignominious
      office. 16 the fears of the people supplied what the discretion
      of the orator had suppressed; and the calamities, which
      afflicted, or threatened, the declining empire, were unanimously
      imputed, by the pagans, to the new religion of christ and of
      constantine.

      (macrob. saturnal. l. v. c. i.) but the luxcriancy of symmachus
      consists of barren leaves, without fruits, and even without
      flowers. few facts, and few sentiments, can be extracted from his
      verbose correspondence.]

      but the hopes of symmachus were repeatedly baffled by the firm
      and dexterous opposition of the archbishop of milan, who
      fortified the emperors against the fallacious eloquence of the
      advocate of rome. in this controversy, ambrose condescends to
      speak the language of a philosopher, and to ask, with some
      contempt, why it should be thought necessary to introduce an
      imaginary and invisible power, as the cause of those victories,
      which were sufficiently explained by the valor and discipline of
      the legions. he justly derides the absurd reverence for
      antiquity, which could only tend to discourage the improvements
      of art, and to replunge the human race into their original
      barbarism. from thence, gradually rising to a more lofty and
      theological tone, he pronounces, that christianity alone is the
      doctrine of truth and salvation; and that every mode of
      polytheism conducts its deluded votaries, through the paths of
      error, to the abyss of eternal perdition. 17 arguments like
      these, when they were suggested by a favorite bishop, had power
      to prevent the restoration of the altar of victory; but the same
      arguments fell, with much more energy and effect, from the mouth
      of a conqueror; and the gods of antiquity were dragged in triumph
      at the chariot-wheels of theodosius. 18 in a full meeting of the
      senate, the emperor proposed, according to the forms of the
      republic, the important question, whether the worship of jupiter,
      or that of christ, should be the religion of the romans. 1811 the
      liberty of suffrages, which he affected to allow, was destroyed
      by the hopes and fears that his presence inspired; and the
      arbitrary exile of symmachus was a recent admonition, that it
      might be dangerous to oppose the wishes of the monarch. on a
      regular division of the senate, jupiter was condemned and
      degraded by the sense of a very large majority; and it is rather
      surprising, that any members should be found bold enough to
      declare, by their speeches and votes, that they were still
      attached to the interest of an abdicated deity. 19 the hasty
      conversion of the senate must be attributed either to
      supernatural or to sordid motives; and many of these reluctant
      proselytes betrayed, on every favorable occasion, their secret
      disposition to throw aside the mask of odious dissimulation. but
      they were gradually fixed in the new religion, as the cause of
      the ancient became more hopeless; they yielded to the authority
      of the emperor, to the fashion of the times, and to the
      entreaties of their wives and children, 20 who were instigated
      and governed by the clergy of rome and the monks of the east. the
      edifying example of the anician family was soon imitated by the
      rest of the nobility: the bassi, the paullini, the gracchi,
      embraced the christian religion; and the luminaries of the
      world, the venerable assembly of catos (such are the high-flown
      expressions of prudentius) were impatient to strip themselves of
      their pontifical garment; to cast the skin of the old serpent; to
      assume the snowy robes of baptismal innocence, and to humble the
      pride of the consular fasces before tombs of the martyrs. 21 the
      citizens, who subsisted by their own industry, and the populace,
      who were supported by the public liberality, filled the churches
      of the lateran, and vatican, with an incessant throng of devout
      proselytes. the decrees of the senate, which proscribed the
      worship of idols, were ratified by the general consent of the
      romans; 22 the splendor of the capitol was defaced, and the
      solitary temples were abandoned to ruin and contempt. 23 rome
      submitted to the yoke of the gospel; and the vanquished provinces
      had not yet lost their reverence for the name and authority of
      rome. 2311

      the same ideas are more copiously expressed in the poetry, if it
      may deserve that name, of prudentius; who composed his two books
      against symmachus (a.d. 404) while that senator was still alive.
      it is whimsical enough that montesquieu (considerations, &c. c.
      xix. tom. iii. p. 487) should overlook the two professed
      antagonists of symmachus, and amuse himself with descanting on

      prudentius concur in asserting the fact of the question being
      solemnly deliberated by the senate, though with directly opposite
      results. zosimus declares that the majority of the assembly
      adhered to the ancient religion of rome; gibbon has adopted the
      authority of prudentius, who, as a latin writer, though a poet,
      deserves more credit than the greek historian. both concur in
      placing this scene after the second triumph of theodosius; but it
      has been almost demonstrated (and gibbonsee the preceding
      noteseems to have acknowledged this) by pagi and tillemont, that
      theodosius did not visit rome after the defeat of eugenius. m.
      beugnot urges, with much force, the improbability that the
      christian emperor would submit such a question to the senate,
      whose authority was nearly obsolete, except on one occasion,
      which was almost hailed as an epoch in the restoration of her
      ancient privileges. the silence of ambrose and of jerom on an
      event so striking, and redounding so much to the honor of
      christianity, is of considerable weight. m. beugnot would ascribe
      the whole scene to the poetic imagination of prudentius; but i
      must observe, that, however prudentius is sometimes elevated by
      the grandeur of his subject to vivid and eloquent language, this
      flight of invention would be so much bolder and more vigorous
      than usual with this poet, that i cannot but suppose there must
      have been some foundation for the story, though it may have been
      exaggerated by the poet, or misrepresented by the historian.m]

      sacrifices ceased, not because they were positively prohibited,

      chapter xxviii: destruction of paganism.part ii.

      the filial piety of the emperors themselves engaged them to
      proceed, with some caution and tenderness, in the reformation of
      the eternal city. those absolute monarchs acted with less regard
      to the prejudices of the provincials. the pious labor which had
      been suspended near twenty years since the death of constantius,
      24 was vigorously resumed, and finally accomplished, by the zeal
      of theodosius. whilst that warlike prince yet struggled with the
      goths, not for the glory, but for the safety, of the republic, he
      ventured to offend a considerable party of his subjects, by some
      acts which might perhaps secure the protection of heaven, but
      which must seem rash and unseasonable in the eye of human
      prudence. the success of his first experiments against the pagans
      encouraged the pious emperor to reiterate and enforce his edicts
      of proscription: the same laws which had been originally
      published in the provinces of the east, were applied, after the
      defeat of maximus, to the whole extent of the western empire; and
      every victory of the orthodox theodosius contributed to the
      triumph of the christian and catholic faith. 25 he attacked
      superstition in her most vital part, by prohibiting the use of
      sacrifices, which he declared to be criminal as well as infamous;
      and if the terms of his edicts more strictly condemned the
      impious curiosity which examined the entrails of the victim, 26
      every subsequent explanation tended to involve in the same guilt
      the general practice of immolation, which essentially constituted
      the religion of the pagans. as the temples had been erected for
      the purpose of sacrifice, it was the duty of a benevolent prince
      to remove from his subjects the dangerous temptation of offending
      against the laws which he had enacted. a special commission was
      granted to cynegius, the prtorian prfect of the east, and
      afterwards to the counts jovius and gaudentius, two officers of
      distinguished rank in the west; by which they were directed to
      shut the temples, to seize or destroy the instruments of
      idolatry, to abolish the privileges of the priests, and to
      confiscate the consecrated property for the benefit of the
      emperor, of the church, or of the army. 27 here the desolation
      might have stopped: and the naked edifices, which were no longer
      employed in the service of idolatry, might have been protected
      from the destructive rage of fanaticism. many of those temples
      were the most splendid and beautiful monuments of grecian
      architecture; and the emperor himself was interested not to
      deface the splendor of his own cities, or to diminish the value
      of his own possessions. those stately edifices might be suffered
      to remain, as so many lasting trophies of the victory of christ.
      in the decline of the arts they might be usefully converted into
      magazines, manufactures, or places of public assembly: and
      perhaps, when the walls of the temple had been sufficiently
      purified by holy rites, the worship of the true deity might be
      allowed to expiate the ancient guilt of idolatry. but as long as
      they subsisted, the pagans fondly cherished the secret hope, that
      an auspicious revolution, a second julian, might again restore
      the altars of the gods: and the earnestness with which they
      addressed their unavailing prayers to the throne, 28 increased
      the zeal of the christian reformers to extirpate, without mercy,
      the root of superstition. the laws of the emperors exhibit some
      symptoms of a milder disposition: 29 but their cold and languid
      efforts were insufficient to stem the torrent of enthusiasm and
      rapine, which was conducted, or rather impelled, by the spiritual
      rulers of the church. in gaul, the holy martin, bishop of tours,
      30 marched at the head of his faithful monks to destroy the
      idols, the temples, and the consecrated trees of his extensive
      diocese; and, in the execution of this arduous task, the prudent
      reader will judge whether martin was supported by the aid of
      miraculous powers, or of carnal weapons. in syria, the divine and
      excellent marcellus, 31 as he is styled by theodoret, a bishop
      animated with apostolic fervor, resolved to level with the ground
      the stately temples within the diocese of apamea. his attack was
      resisted by the skill and solidity with which the temple of
      jupiter had been constructed. the building was seated on an
      eminence: on each of the four sides, the lofty roof was supported
      by fifteen massy columns, sixteen feet in circumference; and the
      large stone, of which they were composed, were firmly cemented
      with lead and iron. the force of the strongest and sharpest tools
      had been tried without effect. it was found necessary to
      undermine the foundations of the columns, which fell down as soon
      as the temporary wooden props had been consumed with fire; and
      the difficulties of the enterprise are described under the
      allegory of a black daemon, who retarded, though he could not
      defeat, the operations of the christian engineers. elated with
      victory, marcellus took the field in person against the powers of
      darkness; a numerous troop of soldiers and gladiators marched
      under the episcopal banner, and he successively attacked the
      villages and country temples of the diocese of apamea. whenever
      any resistance or danger was apprehended, the champion of the
      faith, whose lameness would not allow him either to fight or fly,
      placed himself at a convenient distance, beyond the reach of
      darts. but this prudence was the occasion of his death: he was
      surprised and slain by a body of exasperated rustics; and the
      synod of the province pronounced, without hesitation, that the
      holy marcellus had sacrificed his life in the cause of god. in
      the support of this cause, the monks, who rushed with tumultuous
      fury from the desert, distinguished themselves by their zeal and
      diligence. they deserved the enmity of the pagans; and some of
      them might deserve the reproaches of avarice and intemperance; of
      avarice, which they gratified with holy plunder, and of
      intemperance, which they indulged at the expense of the people,
      who foolishly admired their tattered garments, loud psalmody, and
      artificial paleness. 32 a small number of temples was protected
      by the fears, the venality, the taste, or the prudence, of the
      civil and ecclesiastical governors. the temple of the celestial
      venus at carthage, whose sacred precincts formed a circumference
      of two miles, was judiciously converted into a christian church;
      33 and a similar consecration has preserved inviolate the
      majestic dome of the pantheon at rome. 34 but in almost every
      province of the roman world, an army of fanatics, without
      authority, and without discipline, invaded the peaceful
      inhabitants; and the ruin of the fairest structures of antiquity
      still displays the ravages of those barbarians, who alone had
      time and inclination to execute such laborious destruction.

      in this wide and various prospect of devastation, the spectator
      may distinguish the ruins of the temple of serapis, at
      alexandria. 35 serapis does not appear to have been one of the
      native gods, or monsters, who sprung from the fruitful soil of
      superstitious egypt. 36 the first of the ptolemies had been
      commanded, by a dream, to import the mysterious stranger from the
      coast of pontus, where he had been long adored by the inhabitants
      of sinope; but his attributes and his reign were so imperfectly
      understood, that it became a subject of dispute, whether he
      represented the bright orb of day, or the gloomy monarch of the
      subterraneous regions. 37 the egyptians, who were obstinately
      devoted to the religion of their fathers, refused to admit this
      foreign deity within the walls of their cities. 38 but the
      obsequious priests, who were seduced by the liberality of the
      ptolemies, submitted, without resistance, to the power of the god
      of pontus: an honorable and domestic genealogy was provided; and
      this fortunate usurper was introduced into the throne and bed of
      osiris, 39 the husband of isis, and the celestial monarch of
      egypt. alexandria, which claimed his peculiar protection, gloried
      in the name of the city of serapis. his temple, 40 which rivalled
      the pride and magnificence of the capitol, was erected on the
      spacious summit of an artificial mount, raised one hundred steps
      above the level of the adjacent parts of the city; and the
      interior cavity was strongly supported by arches, and distributed
      into vaults and subterraneous apartments. the consecrated
      buildings were surrounded by a quadrangular portico; the stately
      halls, and exquisite statues, displayed the triumph of the arts;
      and the treasures of ancient learning were preserved in the
      famous alexandrian library, which had arisen with new splendor
      from its ashes. 41 after the edicts of theodosius had severely
      prohibited the sacrifices of the pagans, they were still
      tolerated in the city and temple of serapis; and this singular
      indulgence was imprudently ascribed to the superstitious terrors
      of the christians themselves; as if they had feared to abolish
      those ancient rites, which could alone secure the inundations of
      the nile, the harvests of egypt, and the subsistence of
      constantinople. 42

      at that time 43 the archiepiscopal throne of alexandria was
      filled by theophilus, 44 the perpetual enemy of peace and virtue;
      a bold, bad man, whose hands were alternately polluted with gold
      and with blood. his pious indignation was excited by the honors
      of serapis; and the insults which he offered to an ancient temple
      of bacchus, 4411 convinced the pagans that he meditated a more
      important and dangerous enterprise. in the tumultuous capital of
      egypt, the slightest provocation was sufficient to inflame a
      civil war. the votaries of serapis, whose strength and numbers
      were much inferior to those of their antagonists, rose in arms at
      the instigation of the philosopher olympius, 45 who exhorted them
      to die in the defence of the altars of the gods. these pagan
      fanatics fortified themselves in the temple, or rather fortress,
      of serapis; repelled the besiegers by daring sallies, and a
      resolute defence; and, by the inhuman cruelties which they
      exercised on their christian prisoners, obtained the last
      consolation of despair. the efforts of the prudent magistrate
      were usefully exerted for the establishment of a truce, till the
      answer of theodosius should determine the fate of serapis. the
      two parties assembled, without arms, in the principal square; and
      the imperial rescript was publicly read. but when a sentence of
      destruction against the idols of alexandria was pronounced, the
      christians set up a shout of joy and exultation, whilst the
      unfortunate pagans, whose fury had given way to consternation,
      retired with hasty and silent steps, and eluded, by their flight
      or obscurity, the resentment of their enemies. theophilus
      proceeded to demolish the temple of serapis, without any other
      difficulties, than those which he found in the weight and
      solidity of the materials: but these obstacles proved so
      insuperable, that he was obliged to leave the foundations; and to
      content himself with reducing the edifice itself to a heap of
      rubbish, a part of which was soon afterwards cleared away, to
      make room for a church, erected in honor of the christian
      martyrs. the valuable library of alexandria was pillaged or
      destroyed; and near twenty years afterwards, the appearance of
      the empty shelves excited the regret and indignation of every
      spectator, whose mind was not totally darkened by religious
      prejudice. 46 the compositions of ancient genius, so many of
      which have irretrievably perished, might surely have been
      excepted from the wreck of idolatry, for the amusement and
      instruction of succeeding ages; and either the zeal or the
      avarice of the archbishop, 47 might have been satiated with the
      rich spoils, which were the reward of his victory. while the
      images and vases of gold and silver were carefully melted, and
      those of a less valuable metal were contemptuously broken, and
      cast into the streets, theophilus labored to expose the frauds
      and vices of the ministers of the idols; their dexterity in the
      management of the loadstone; their secret methods of introducing
      a human actor into a hollow statue; 4711 and their scandalous
      abuse of the confidence of devout husbands and unsuspecting
      females. 48 charges like these may seem to deserve some degree of
      credit, as they are not repugnant to the crafty and interested
      spirit of superstition. but the same spirit is equally prone to
      the base practice of insulting and calumniating a fallen enemy;
      and our belief is naturally checked by the reflection, that it is
      much less difficult to invent a fictitious story, than to support
      a practical fraud. the colossal statue of serapis 49 was involved
      in the ruin of his temple and religion. a great number of plates
      of different metals, artificially joined together, composed the
      majestic figure of the deity, who touched on either side the
      walls of the sanctuary. the aspect of serapis, his sitting
      posture, and the sceptre, which he bore in his left hand, were
      extremely similar to the ordinary representations of jupiter. he
      was distinguished from jupiter by the basket, or bushel, which
      was placed on his head; and by the emblematic monster which he
      held in his right hand; the head and body of a serpent branching
      into three tails, which were again terminated by the triple heads
      of a dog, a lion, and a wolf. it was confidently affirmed, that
      if any impious hand should dare to violate the majesty of the
      god, the heavens and the earth would instantly return to their
      original chaos. an intrepid soldier, animated by zeal, and armed
      with a weighty battle-axe, ascended the ladder; and even the
      christian multitude expected, with some anxiety, the event of the
      combat. 50 he aimed a vigorous stroke against the cheek of
      serapis; the cheek fell to the ground; the thunder was still
      silent, and both the heavens and the earth continued to preserve
      their accustomed order and tranquillity. the victorious soldier
      repeated his blows: the huge idol was overthrown, and broken in
      pieces; and the limbs of serapis were ignominiously dragged
      through the streets of alexandria. his mangled carcass was burnt
      in the amphitheatre, amidst the shouts of the populace; and many
      persons attributed their conversion to this discovery of the
      impotence of their tutelar deity. the popular modes of religion,
      that propose any visible and material objects of worship, have
      the advantage of adapting and familiarizing themselves to the
      senses of mankind: but this advantage is counterbalanced by the
      various and inevitable accidents to which the faith of the
      idolater is exposed. it is scarcely possible, that, in every
      disposition of mind, he should preserve his implicit reverence
      for the idols, or the relics, which the naked eye, and the
      profane hand, are unable to distinguish from the most common
      productions of art or nature; and if, in the hour of danger,
      their secret and miraculous virtue does not operate for their own
      preservation, he scorns the vain apologies of his priests, and
      justly derides the object, and the folly, of his superstitious
      attachment. 51 after the fall of serapis, some hopes were still
      entertained by the pagans, that the nile would refuse his annual
      supply to the impious masters of egypt; and the extraordinary
      delay of the inundation seemed to announce the displeasure of the
      river-god. but this delay was soon compensated by the rapid swell
      of the waters. they suddenly rose to such an unusual height, as
      to comfort the discontented party with the pleasing expectation
      of a deluge; till the peaceful river again subsided to the
      well-known and fertilizing level of sixteen cubits, or about
      thirty english feet. 52

      the temples of the roman empire were deserted, or destroyed; but
      the ingenious superstition of the pagans still attempted to elude
      the laws of theodosius, by which all sacrifices had been severely
      prohibited. the inhabitants of the country, whose conduct was
      less opposed to the eye of malicious curiosity, disguised their
      religious, under the appearance of convivial, meetings. on the
      days of solemn festivals, they assembled in great numbers under
      the spreading shade of some consecrated trees; sheep and oxen
      were slaughtered and roasted; and this rural entertainment was
      sanctified by the use of incense, and by the hymns which were
      sung in honor of the gods. but it was alleged, that, as no part
      of the animal was made a burnt-offering, as no altar was provided
      to receive the blood, and as the previous oblation of salt cakes,
      and the concluding ceremony of libations, were carefully omitted,
      these festal meetings did not involve the guests in the guilt, or
      penalty, of an illegal sacrifice. 53 whatever might be the truth
      of the facts, or the merit of the distinction, 54 these vain
      pretences were swept away by the last edict of theodosius, which
      inflicted a deadly wound on the superstition of the pagans. 55
      5511 this prohibitory law is expressed in the most absolute and
      comprehensive terms. it is our will and pleasure, says the
      emperor, that none of our subjects, whether magistrates or
      private citizens, however exalted or however humble may be their
      rank and condition, shall presume, in any city or in any place,
      to worship an inanimate idol, by the sacrifice of a guiltless
      victim. the act of sacrificing, and the practice of divination
      by the entrails of the victim, are declared (without any regard
      to the object of the inquiry) a crime of high treason against the
      state, which can be expiated only by the death of the guilty. the
      rites of pagan superstition, which might seem less bloody and
      atrocious, are abolished, as highly injurious to the truth and
      honor of religion; luminaries, garlands, frankincense, and
      libations of wine, are specially enumerated and condemned; and
      the harmless claims of the domestic genius, of the household
      gods, are included in this rigorous proscription. the use of any
      of these profane and illegal ceremonies, subjects the offender to
      the forfeiture of the house or estate, where they have been
      performed; and if he has artfully chosen the property of another
      for the scene of his impiety, he is compelled to discharge,
      without delay, a heavy fine of twenty-five pounds of gold, or
      more than one thousand pounds sterling. a fine, not less
      considerable, is imposed on the connivance of the secret enemies
      of religion, who shall neglect the duty of their respective
      stations, either to reveal, or to punish, the guilt of idolatry.

      chapter xxviii: destruction of paganism.part iii.

      in the cruel reigns of decius and diocletian, christianity had
      been proscribed, as a revolt from the ancient and hereditary
      religion of the empire; and the unjust suspicions which were
      entertained of a dark and dangerous faction, were, in some
      measure, countenanced by the inseparable union and rapid
      conquests of the catholic church. but the same excuses of fear
      and ignorance cannot be applied to the christian emperors who
      violated the precepts of humanity and of the gospel. the
      experience of ages had betrayed the weakness, as well as folly,
      of paganism; the light of reason and of faith had already
      exposed, to the greatest part of mankind, the vanity of idols;
      and the declining sect, which still adhered to their worship,
      might have been permitted to enjoy, in peace and obscurity, the
      religious costumes of their ancestors. had the pagans been
      animated by the undaunted zeal which possessed the minds of the
      primitive believers, the triumph of the church must have been
      stained with blood; and the martyrs of jupiter and apollo might
      have embraced the glorious opportunity of devoting their lives
      and fortunes at the foot of their altars. but such obstinate zeal
      was not congenial to the loose and careless temper of polytheism.
      the violent and repeated strokes of the orthodox princes were
      broken by the soft and yielding substance against which they were
      directed; and the ready obedience of the pagans protected them
      from the pains and penalties of the theodosian code. 57 instead
      of asserting, that the authority of the gods was superior to that
      of the emperor, they desisted, with a plaintive murmur, from the
      use of those sacred rites which their sovereign had condemned. if
      they were sometimes tempted by a sally of passion, or by the
      hopes of concealment, to indulge their favorite superstition,
      their humble repentance disarmed the severity of the christian
      magistrate, and they seldom refused to atone for their rashness,
      by submitting, with some secret reluctance, to the yoke of the
      gospel. the churches were filled with the increasing multitude of
      these unworthy proselytes, who had conformed, from temporal
      motives, to the reigning religion; and whilst they devoutly
      imitated the postures, and recited the prayers, of the faithful,
      they satisfied their conscience by the silent and sincere
      invocation of the gods of antiquity. 58 if the pagans wanted
      patience to suffer they wanted spirit to resist; and the
      scattered myriads, who deplored the ruin of the temples, yielded,
      without a contest, to the fortune of their adversaries. the
      disorderly opposition 59 of the peasants of syria, and the
      populace of alexandria, to the rage of private fanaticism, was
      silenced by the name and authority of the emperor. the pagans of
      the west, without contributing to the elevation of eugenius,
      disgraced, by their partial attachment, the cause and character
      of the usurper. the clergy vehemently exclaimed, that he
      aggravated the crime of rebellion by the guilt of apostasy; that,
      by his permission, the altar of victory was again restored; and
      that the idolatrous symbols of jupiter and hercules were
      displayed in the field, against the invincible standard of the
      cross. but the vain hopes of the pagans were soon annihilated by
      the defeat of eugenius; and they were left exposed to the
      resentment of the conqueror, who labored to deserve the favor of
      heaven by the extirpation of idolatry. 60

      a nation of slaves is always prepared to applaud the clemency of
      their master, who, in the abuse of absolute power, does not
      proceed to the last extremes of injustice and oppression.
      theodosius might undoubtedly have proposed to his pagan subjects
      the alternative of baptism or of death; and the eloquent libanius
      has praised the moderation of a prince, who never enacted, by any
      positive law, that all his subjects should immediately embrace
      and practise the religion of their sovereign. 61 the profession
      of christianity was not made an essential qualification for the
      enjoyment of the civil rights of society, nor were any peculiar
      hardships imposed on the sectaries, who credulously received the
      fables of ovid, and obstinately rejected the miracles of the
      gospel. the palace, the schools, the army, and the senate, were
      filled with declared and devout pagans; they obtained, without
      distinction, the civil and military honors of the empire. 6111
      theodosius distinguished his liberal regard for virtue and genius
      by the consular dignity, which he bestowed on symmachus; 62 and
      by the personal friendship which he expressed to libanius; 63 and
      the two eloquent apologists of paganism were never required
      either to change or to dissemble their religious opinions. the
      pagans were indulged in the most licentious freedom of speech and
      writing; the historical and philosophic remains of eunapius,
      zosimus, 64 and the fanatic teachers of the school of plato,
      betray the most furious animosity, and contain the sharpest
      invectives, against the sentiments and conduct of their
      victorious adversaries. if these audacious libels were publicly
      known, we must applaud the good sense of the christian princes,
      who viewed, with a smile of contempt, the last struggles of
      superstition and despair. 65 but the imperial laws, which
      prohibited the sacrifices and ceremonies of paganism, were
      rigidly executed; and every hour contributed to destroy the
      influence of a religion, which was supported by custom, rather
      than by argument. the devotion or the poet, or the philosopher,
      may be secretly nourished by prayer, meditation, and study; but
      the exercise of public worship appears to be the only solid
      foundation of the religious sentiments of the people, which
      derive their force from imitation and habit. the interruption of
      that public exercise may consummate, in the period of a few
      years, the important work of a national revolution. the memory of
      theological opinions cannot long be preserved, without the
      artificial helps of priests, of temples, and of books. 66 the
      ignorant vulgar, whose minds are still agitated by the blind
      hopes and terrors of superstition, will be soon persuaded by
      their superiors to direct their vows to the reigning deities of
      the age; and will insensibly imbibe an ardent zeal for the
      support and propagation of the new doctrine, which spiritual
      hunger at first compelled them to accept. the generation that
      arose in the world after the promulgation of the imperial laws,
      was attracted within the pale of the catholic church: and so
      rapid, yet so gentle, was the fall of paganism, that only
      twenty-eight years after the death of theodosius, the faint and
      minute vestiges were no longer visible to the eye of the
      legislator. 67

      the ruin of the pagan religion is described by the sophists as a
      dreadful and amazing prodigy, which covered the earth with
      darkness, and restored the ancient dominion of chaos and of
      night. they relate, in solemn and pathetic strains, that the
      temples were converted into sepulchres, and that the holy places,
      which had been adorned by the statues of the gods, were basely
      polluted by the relics of christian martyrs. the monks (a race
      of filthy animals, to whom eunapius is tempted to refuse the name
      of men) are the authors of the new worship, which, in the place
      of those deities who are conceived by the understanding, has
      substituted the meanest and most contemptible slaves. the heads,
      salted and pickled, of those infamous malefactors, who for the
      multitude of their crimes have suffered a just and ignominious
      death; their bodies still marked by the impression of the lash,
      and the scars of those tortures which were inflicted by the
      sentence of the magistrate; such (continues eunapius) are the
      gods which the earth produces in our days; such are the martyrs,
      the supreme arbitrators of our prayers and petitions to the
      deity, whose tombs are now consecrated as the objects of the
      veneration of the people. 68 without approving the malice, it is
      natural enough to share the surprise of the sophist, the
      spectator of a revolution, which raised those obscure victims of
      the laws of rome to the rank of celestial and invisible
      protectors of the roman empire. the grateful respect of the
      christians for the martyrs of the faith, was exalted, by time and
      victory, into religious adoration; and the most illustrious of
      the saints and prophets were deservedly associated to the honors
      of the martyrs. one hundred and fifty years after the glorious
      deaths of st. peter and st. paul, the vatican and the ostian road
      were distinguished by the tombs, or rather by the trophies, of
      those spiritual heroes. 69 in the age which followed the
      conversion of constantine, the emperors, the consuls, and the
      generals of armies, devoutly visited the sepulchres of a
      tentmaker and a fisherman; 70 and their venerable bones were
      deposited under the altars of christ, on which the bishops of the
      royal city continually offered the unbloody sacrifice. 71 the new
      capital of the eastern world, unable to produce any ancient and
      domestic trophies, was enriched by the spoils of dependent
      provinces. the bodies of st. andrew, st. luke, and st. timothy,
      had reposed near three hundred years in the obscure graves, from
      whence they were transported, in solemn pomp, to the church of
      the apostles, which the magnificence of constantine had founded
      on the banks of the thracian bosphorus. 72 about fifty years
      afterwards, the same banks were honored by the presence of
      samuel, the judge and prophet of the people of israel. his ashes,
      deposited in a golden vase, and covered with a silken veil, were
      delivered by the bishops into each others hands. the relics of
      samuel were received by the people with the same joy and
      reverence which they would have shown to the living prophet; the
      highways, from palestine to the gates of constantinople, were
      filled with an uninterrupted procession; and the emperor arcadius
      himself, at the head of the most illustrious members of the
      clergy and senate, advanced to meet his extraordinary guest, who
      had always deserved and claimed the homage of kings. 73 the
      example of rome and constantinople confirmed the faith and
      discipline of the catholic world. the honors of the saints and
      martyrs, after a feeble and ineffectual murmur of profane reason,
      74 were universally established; and in the age of ambrose and
      jerom, something was still deemed wanting to the sanctity of a
      christian church, till it had been consecrated by some portion of
      holy relics, which fixed and inflamed the devotion of the
      faithful.

      adopted and cherished this pernicious innovation.

      i. the satisfactory experience, that the relics of saints were
      more valuable than gold or precious stones, 75 stimulated the
      clergy to multiply the treasures of the church. without much
      regard for truth or probability, they invented names for
      skeletons, and actions for names. the fame of the apostles, and
      of the holy men who had imitated their virtues, was darkened by
      religious fiction. to the invincible band of genuine and
      primitive martyrs, they added myriads of imaginary heroes, who
      had never existed, except in the fancy of crafty or credulous
      legendaries; and there is reason to suspect, that tours might not
      be the only diocese in which the bones of a malefactor were
      adored, instead of those of a saint. 76 a superstitious practice,
      which tended to increase the temptations of fraud, and credulity,
      insensibly extinguished the light of history, and of reason, in
      the christian world.

      ii. but the progress of superstition would have been much less
      rapid and victorious, if the faith of the people had not been
      assisted by the seasonable aid of visions and miracles, to
      ascertain the authenticity and virtue of the most suspicious
      relics. in the reign of the younger theodosius, lucian, 77 a
      presbyter of jerusalem, and the ecclesiastical minister of the
      village of caphargamala, about twenty miles from the city,
      related a very singular dream, which, to remove his doubts, had
      been repeated on three successive saturdays. a venerable figure
      stood before him, in the silence of the night, with a long beard,
      a white robe, and a gold rod; announced himself by the name of
      gamaliel, and revealed to the astonished presbyter, that his own
      corpse, with the bodies of his son abibas, his friend nicodemus,
      and the illustrious stephen, the first martyr of the christian
      faith, were secretly buried in the adjacent field. he added, with
      some impatience, that it was time to release himself and his
      companions from their obscure prison; that their appearance would
      be salutary to a distressed world; and that they had made choice
      of lucian to inform the bishop of jerusalem of their situation
      and their wishes. the doubts and difficulties which still
      retarded this important discovery were successively removed by
      new visions; and the ground was opened by the bishop, in the
      presence of an innumerable multitude. the coffins of gamaliel, of
      his son, and of his friend, were found in regular order; but when
      the fourth coffin, which contained the remains of stephen, was
      shown to the light, the earth trembled, and an odor, such as that
      of paradise, was smelt, which instantly cured the various
      diseases of seventy-three of the assistants. the companions of
      stephen were left in their peaceful residence of caphargamala:
      but the relics of the first martyr were transported, in solemn
      procession, to a church constructed in their honor on mount sion;
      and the minute particles of those relics, a drop of blood, 78 or
      the scrapings of a bone, were acknowledged, in almost every
      province of the roman world, to possess a divine and miraculous
      virtue. the grave and learned augustin, 79 whose understanding
      scarcely admits the excuse of credulity, has attested the
      innumerable prodigies which were performed in africa by the
      relics of st. stephen; and this marvellous narrative is inserted
      in the elaborate work of the city of god, which the bishop of
      hippo designed as a solid and immortal proof of the truth of
      christianity. augustin solemnly declares, that he has selected
      those miracles only which were publicly certified by the persons
      who were either the objects, or the spectators, of the power of
      the martyr. many prodigies were omitted, or forgotten; and hippo
      had been less favorably treated than the other cities of the
      province. and yet the bishop enumerates above seventy miracles,
      of which three were resurrections from the dead, in the space of
      two years, and within the limits of his own diocese. 80 if we
      enlarge our view to all the dioceses, and all the saints, of the
      christian world, it will not be easy to calculate the fables, and
      the errors, which issued from this inexhaustible source. but we
      may surely be allowed to observe, that a miracle, in that age of
      superstition and credulity, lost its name and its merit, since it
      could scarcely be considered as a deviation from the ordinary and
      established laws of nature.

      iii. the innumerable miracles, of which the tombs of the martyrs
      were the perpetual theatre, revealed to the pious believer the
      actual state and constitution of the invisible world; and his
      religious speculations appeared to be founded on the firm basis
      of fact and experience. whatever might be the condition of vulgar
      souls, in the long interval between the dissolution and the
      resurrection of their bodies, it was evident that the superior
      spirits of the saints and martyrs did not consume that portion of
      their existence in silent and inglorious sleep. 81 it was evident
      (without presuming to determine the place of their habitation, or
      the nature of their felicity) that they enjoyed the lively and
      active consciousness of their happiness, their virtue, and their
      powers; and that they had already secured the possession of their
      eternal reward. the enlargement of their intellectual faculties
      surpassed the measure of the human imagination; since it was
      proved by experience, that they were capable of hearing and
      understanding the various petitions of their numerous votaries;
      who, in the same moment of time, but in the most distant parts of
      the world, invoked the name and assistance of stephen or of
      martin. 82 the confidence of their petitioners was founded on the
      persuasion, that the saints, who reigned with christ, cast an eye
      of pity upon earth; that they were warmly interested in the
      prosperity of the catholic church; and that the individuals, who
      imitated the example of their faith and piety, were the peculiar
      and favorite objects of their most tender regard. sometimes,
      indeed, their friendship might be influenced by considerations of
      a less exalted kind: they viewed with partial affection the
      places which had been consecrated by their birth, their
      residence, their death, their burial, or the possession of their
      relics. the meaner passions of pride, avarice, and revenge, may
      be deemed unworthy of a celestial breast; yet the saints
      themselves condescended to testify their grateful approbation of
      the liberality of their votaries; and the sharpest bolts of
      punishment were hurled against those impious wretches, who
      violated their magnificent shrines, or disbelieved their
      supernatural power. 83 atrocious, indeed, must have been the
      guilt, and strange would have been the scepticism, of those men,
      if they had obstinately resisted the proofs of a divine agency,
      which the elements, the whole range of the animal creation, and
      even the subtle and invisible operations of the human mind, were
      compelled to obey. 84 the immediate, and almost instantaneous,
      effects that were supposed to follow the prayer, or the offence,
      satisfied the christians of the ample measure of favor and
      authority which the saints enjoyed in the presence of the supreme
      god; and it seemed almost superfluous to inquire whether they
      were continually obliged to intercede before the throne of grace;
      or whether they might not be permitted to exercise, according to
      the dictates of their benevolence and justice, the delegated
      powers of their subordinate ministry. the imagination, which had
      been raised by a painful effort to the contemplation and worship
      of the universal cause, eagerly embraced such inferior objects of
      adoration as were more proportioned to its gross conceptions and
      imperfect faculties. the sublime and simple theology of the
      primitive christians was gradually corrupted; and the monarchy of
      heaven, already clouded by metaphysical subtleties, was degraded
      by the introduction of a popular mythology, which tended to
      restore the reign of polytheism. 85

      iv. as the objects of religion were gradually reduced to the
      standard of the imagination, the rites and ceremonies were
      introduced that seemed most powerfully to affect the senses of
      the vulgar. if, in the beginning of the fifth century, 86
      tertullian, or lactantius, 87 had been suddenly raised from the
      dead, to assist at the festival of some popular saint, or martyr,
      88 they would have gazed with astonishment, and indignation, on
      the profane spectacle, which had succeeded to the pure and
      spiritual worship of a christian congregation. as soon as the
      doors of the church were thrown open, they must have been
      offended by the smoke of incense, the perfume of flowers, and the
      glare of lamps and tapers, which diffused, at noonday, a gaudy,
      superfluous, and, in their opinion, a sacrilegious light. if they
      approached the balustrade of the altar, they made their way
      through the prostrate crowd, consisting, for the most part, of
      strangers and pilgrims, who resorted to the city on the vigil of
      the feast; and who already felt the strong intoxication of
      fanaticism, and, perhaps, of wine. their devout kisses were
      imprinted on the walls and pavement of the sacred edifice; and
      their fervent prayers were directed, whatever might be the
      language of their church, to the bones, the blood, or the ashes
      of the saint, which were usually concealed, by a linen or silken
      veil, from the eyes of the vulgar. the christians frequented the
      tombs of the martyrs, in the hope of obtaining, from their
      powerful intercession, every sort of spiritual, but more
      especially of temporal, blessings. they implored the preservation
      of their health, or the cure of their infirmities; the
      fruitfulness of their barren wives, or the safety and happiness
      of their children. whenever they undertook any distant or
      dangerous journey, they requested, that the holy martyrs would be
      their guides and protectors on the road; and if they returned
      without having experienced any misfortune, they again hastened to
      the tombs of the martyrs, to celebrate, with grateful
      thanksgivings, their obligations to the memory and relics of
      those heavenly patrons. the walls were hung round with symbols of
      the favors which they had received; eyes, and hands, and feet, of
      gold and silver: and edifying pictures, which could not long
      escape the abuse of indiscreet or idolatrous devotion,
      represented the image, the attributes, and the miracles of the
      tutelar saint. the same uniform original spirit of superstition
      might suggest, in the most distant ages and countries, the same
      methods of deceiving the credulity, and of affecting the senses
      of mankind: 89 but it must ingenuously be confessed, that the
      ministers of the catholic church imitated the profane model,
      which they were impatient to destroy. the most respectable
      bishops had persuaded themselves that the ignorant rustics would
      more cheerfully renounce the superstitions of paganism, if they
      found some resemblance, some compensation, in the bosom of
      christianity. the religion of constantine achieved, in less than
      a century, the final conquest of the roman empire: but the
      victors themselves were insensibly subdued by the arts of their

      chapter xxix: division of roman empire between sons of
      theodosius.part i.

     final division of the roman empire between the sons of
     theodosius.reign of arcadius and honoriusadministration of
     rufinus and stilicho.revolt and defeat of gildo in africa.

      the genius of rome expired with theodosius; the last of the
      successors of augustus and constantine, who appeared in the field
      at the head of their armies, and whose authority was universally
      acknowledged throughout the whole extent of the empire. the
      memory of his virtues still continued, however, to protect the
      feeble and inexperienced youth of his two sons. after the death
      of their father, arcadius and honorius were saluted, by the
      unanimous consent of mankind, as the lawful emperors of the east,
      and of the west; and the oath of fidelity was eagerly taken by
      every order of the state; the senates of old and new rome, the
      clergy, the magistrates, the soldiers, and the people. arcadius,
      who was then about eighteen years of age, was born in spain, in
      the humble habitation of a private family. but he received a
      princely education in the palace of constantinople; and his
      inglorious life was spent in that peaceful and splendid seat of
      royalty, from whence he appeared to reign over the provinces of
      thrace, asia minor, syria, and egypt, from the lower danube to
      the confines of persia and thiopia. his younger brother
      honorius, assumed, in the eleventh year of his age, the nominal
      government of italy, africa, gaul, spain, and britain; and the
      troops, which guarded the frontiers of his kingdom, were opposed,
      on one side, to the caledonians, and on the other, to the moors.
      the great and martial prfecture of illyricum was divided
      between the two princes: the defence and possession of the
      provinces of noricum, pannonia, and dalmatia still belonged to
      the western empire; but the two large dioceses of dacia and
      macedonia, which gratian had intrusted to the valor of
      theodosius, were forever united to the empire of the east. the
      boundary in europe was not very different from the line which now
      separates the germans and the turks; and the respective
      advantages of territory, riches, populousness, and military
      strength, were fairly balanced and compensated, in this final and
      permanent division of the roman empire. the hereditary sceptre of
      the sons of theodosius appeared to be the gift of nature, and of
      their father; the generals and ministers had been accustomed to
      adore the majesty of the royal infants; and the army and people
      were not admonished of their rights, and of their power, by the
      dangerous example of a recent election. the gradual discovery of
      the weakness of arcadius and honorius, and the repeated
      calamities of their reign, were not sufficient to obliterate the
      deep and early impressions of loyalty. the subjects of rome, who
      still reverenced the persons, or rather the names, of their
      sovereigns, beheld, with equal abhorrence, the rebels who
      opposed, and the ministers who abused, the authority of the
      throne.

      theodosius had tarnished the glory of his reign by the elevation
      of rufinus; an odious favorite, who, in an age of civil and
      religious faction, has deserved, from every party, the imputation
      of every crime. the strong impulse of ambition and avarice 1 had
      urged rufinus to abandon his native country, an obscure corner of
      gaul, 2 to advance his fortune in the capital of the east: the
      talent of bold and ready elocution, 3 qualified him to succeed in
      the lucrative profession of the law; and his success in that
      profession was a regular step to the most honorable and important
      employments of the state. he was raised, by just degrees, to the
      station of master of the offices. in the exercise of his various
      functions, so essentially connected with the whole system of
      civil government, he acquired the confidence of a monarch, who
      soon discovered his diligence and capacity in business, and who
      long remained ignorant of the pride, the malice, and the
      covetousness of his disposition. these vices were concealed
      beneath the mask of profound dissimulation; 4 his passions were
      subservient only to the passions of his master; yet in the horrid
      massacre of thessalonica, the cruel rufinus inflamed the fury,
      without imitating the repentance, of theodosius. the minister,
      who viewed with proud indifference the rest of mankind, never
      forgave the appearance of an injury; and his personal enemies had
      forfeited, in his opinion, the merit of all public services.
      promotus, the master-general of the infantry, had saved the
      empire from the invasion of the ostrogoths; but he indignantly
      supported the preeminence of a rival, whose character and
      profession he despised; and in the midst of a public council, the
      impatient soldier was provoked to chastise with a blow the
      indecent pride of the favorite. this act of violence was
      represented to the emperor as an insult, which it was incumbent
      on his dignity to resent. the disgrace and exile of promotus were
      signified by a peremptory order, to repair, without delay, to a
      military station on the banks of the danube; and the death of
      that general (though he was slain in a skirmish with the
      barbarians) was imputed to the perfidious arts of rufinus. 5 the
      sacrifice of a hero gratified his revenge; the honors of the
      consulship elated his vanity; but his power was still imperfect
      and precarious, as long as the important posts of prfect of the
      east, and of prfect of constantinople, were filled by tatian, 6
      and his son proculus; whose united authority balanced, for some
      time, the ambition and favor of the master of the offices. the
      two prfects were accused of rapine and corruption in the
      administration of the laws and finances. for the trial of these
      illustrious offenders, the emperor constituted a special
      commission: several judges were named to share the guilt and
      reproach of injustice; but the right of pronouncing sentence was
      reserved to the president alone, and that president was rufinus
      himself. the father, stripped of the prfecture of the east, was
      thrown into a dungeon; but the son, conscious that few ministers
      can be found innocent, where an enemy is their judge, had
      secretly escaped; and rufinus must have been satisfied with the
      least obnoxious victim, if despotism had not condescended to
      employ the basest and most ungenerous artifice. the prosecution
      was conducted with an appearance of equity and moderation, which
      flattered tatian with the hope of a favorable event: his
      confidence was fortified by the solemn assurances, and perfidious
      oaths, of the president, who presumed to interpose the sacred
      name of theodosius himself; and the unhappy father was at last
      persuaded to recall, by a private letter, the fugitive proculus.
      he was instantly seized, examined, condemned, and beheaded, in
      one of the suburbs of constantinople, with a precipitation which
      disappointed the clemency of the emperor. without respecting the
      misfortunes of a consular senator, the cruel judges of tatian
      compelled him to behold the execution of his son: the fatal cord
      was fastened round his own neck; but in the moment when he
      expected. and perhaps desired, the relief of a speedy death, he
      was permitted to consume the miserable remnant of his old age in
      poverty and exile. 7 the punishment of the two prfects might,
      perhaps, be excused by the exceptionable parts of their own
      conduct; the enmity of rufinus might be palliated by the jealous
      and unsociable nature of ambition. but he indulged a spirit of
      revenge equally repugnant to prudence and to justice, when he
      degraded their native country of lycia from the rank of roman
      provinces; stigmatized a guiltless people with a mark of
      ignominy; and declared, that the countrymen of tatian and
      proculus should forever remain incapable of holding any
      employment of honor or advantage under the imperial government. 8
      the new prfect of the east (for rufinus instantly succeeded to
      the vacant honors of his adversary) was not diverted, however, by
      the most criminal pursuits, from the performance of the religious
      duties, which in that age were considered as the most essential
      to salvation. in the suburb of chalcedon, surnamed the oak, he
      had built a magnificent villa; to which he devoutly added a
      stately church, consecrated to the apostles st. peter and st.
      paul, and continually sanctified by the prayers and penance of a
      regular society of monks. a numerous, and almost general, synod
      of the bishops of the eastern empire, was summoned to celebrate,
      at the same time, the dedication of the church, and the baptism
      of the founder. this double ceremony was performed with
      extraordinary pomp; and when rufinus was purified, in the holy
      font, from all the sins that he had hitherto committed, a
      venerable hermit of egypt rashly proposed himself as the sponsor
      of a proud and ambitious statesman. 9

      the character of theodosius imposed on his minister the task of
      hypocrisy, which disguised, and sometimes restrained, the abuse
      of power; and rufinus was apprehensive of disturbing the indolent
      slumber of a prince still capable of exerting the abilities and
      the virtue, which had raised him to the throne. 10 but the
      absence, and, soon afterwards, the death, of the emperor,
      confirmed the absolute authority of rufinus over the person and
      dominions of arcadius; a feeble youth, whom the imperious
      prfect considered as his pupil, rather than his sovereign.
      regardless of the public opinion, he indulged his passions
      without remorse, and without resistance; and his malignant and
      rapacious spirit rejected every passion that might have
      contributed to his own glory, or the happiness of the people. his
      avarice, 11 which seems to have prevailed, in his corrupt mind,
      over every other sentiment, attracted the wealth of the east, by
      the various arts of partial and general extortion; oppressive
      taxes, scandalous bribery, immoderate fines, unjust
      confiscations, forced or fictitious testaments, by which the
      tyrant despoiled of their lawful inheritance the children of
      strangers, or enemies; and the public sale of justice, as well as
      of favor, which he instituted in the palace of constantinople.
      the ambitious candidate eagerly solicited, at the expense of the
      fairest part of his patrimony, the honors and emoluments of some
      provincial government; the lives and fortunes of the unhappy
      people were abandoned to the most liberal purchaser; and the
      public discontent was sometimes appeased by the sacrifice of an
      unpopular criminal, whose punishment was profitable only to the
      prfect of the east, his accomplice and his judge. if avarice
      were not the blindest of the human passions, the motives of
      rufinus might excite our curiosity; and we might be tempted to
      inquire with what view he violated every principle of humanity
      and justice, to accumulate those immense treasures, which he
      could not spend without folly, nor possess without danger.
      perhaps he vainly imagined, that he labored for the interest of
      an only daughter, on whom he intended to bestow his royal pupil,
      and the august rank of empress of the east. perhaps he deceived
      himself by the opinion, that his avarice was the instrument of
      his ambition. he aspired to place his fortune on a secure and
      independent basis, which should no longer depend on the caprice
      of the young emperor; yet he neglected to conciliate the hearts
      of the soldiers and people, by the liberal distribution of those
      riches, which he had acquired with so much toil, and with so much
      guilt. the extreme parsimony of rufinus left him only the
      reproach and envy of ill-gotten wealth; his dependants served him
      without attachment; the universal hatred of mankind was repressed
      only by the influence of servile fear. the fate of lucian
      proclaimed to the east, that the prfect, whose industry was
      much abated in the despatch of ordinary business, was active and
      indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge. lucian, the son of the
      prfect florentius, the oppressor of gaul, and the enemy of
      julian, had employed a considerable part of his inheritance, the
      fruit of rapine and corruption, to purchase the friendship of
      rufinus, and the high office of count of the east. but the new
      magistrate imprudently departed from the maxims of the court, and
      of the times; disgraced his benefactor by the contrast of a
      virtuous and temperate administration; and presumed to refuse an
      act of injustice, which might have tended to the profit of the
      emperors uncle. arcadius was easily persuaded to resent the
      supposed insult; and the prfect of the east resolved to execute
      in person the cruel vengeance, which he meditated against this
      ungrateful delegate of his power. he performed with incessant
      speed the journey of seven or eight hundred miles, from
      constantinople to antioch, entered the capital of syria at the
      dead of night, and spread universal consternation among a people
      ignorant of his design, but not ignorant of his character. the
      count of the fifteen provinces of the east was dragged, like the
      vilest malefactor, before the arbitrary tribunal of rufinus.
      notwithstanding the clearest evidence of his integrity, which was
      not impeached even by the voice of an accuser, lucian was
      condemned, almost with out a trial, to suffer a cruel and
      ignominious punishment. the ministers of the tyrant, by the
      orders, and in the presence, of their master, beat him on the
      neck with leather thongs armed at the extremities with lead; and
      when he fainted under the violence of the pain, he was removed in
      a close litter, to conceal his dying agonies from the eyes of the
      indignant city. no sooner had rufinus perpetrated this inhuman
      act, the sole object of his expedition, than he returned, amidst
      the deep and silent curses of a trembling people, from antioch to
      constantinople; and his diligence was accelerated by the hope of
      accomplishing, without delay, the nuptials of his daughter with
      the emperor of the east. 12

      statute always proves the existence of tyranny; but a laudable

      this allusion of claudian (in rufin. i. 241) is again explained
      by the circumstantial narrative of zosimus, (l. v. p. 288, 289.)]

      but rufinus soon experienced, that a prudent minister should
      constantly secure his royal captive by the strong, though
      invisible chain of habit; and that the merit, and much more
      easily the favor, of the absent, are obliterated in a short time
      from the mind of a weak and capricious sovereign. while the
      prfect satiated his revenge at antioch, a secret conspiracy of
      the favorite eunuchs, directed by the great chamberlain
      eutropius, undermined his power in the palace of constantinople.
      they discovered that arcadius was not inclined to love the
      daughter of rufinus, who had been chosen, without his consent,
      for his bride; and they contrived to substitute in her place the
      fair eudoxia, the daughter of bauto, 13 a general of the franks
      in the service of rome; and who was educated, since the death of
      her father, in the family of the sons of promotus. the young
      emperor, whose chastity had been strictly guarded by the pious
      care of his tutor arsenius, 14 eagerly listened to the artful and
      flattering descriptions of the charms of eudoxia: he gazed with
      impatient ardor on her picture, and he understood the necessity
      of concealing his amorous designs from the knowledge of a
      minister who was so deeply interested to oppose the consummation
      of his happiness. soon after the return of rufinus, the
      approaching ceremony of the royal nuptials was announced to the
      people of constantinople, who prepared to celebrate, with false
      and hollow acclamations, the fortune of his daughter. a splendid
      train of eunuchs and officers issued, in hymeneal pomp, from the
      gates of the palace; bearing aloft the diadem, the robes, and the
      inestimable ornaments, of the future empress. the solemn
      procession passed through the streets of the city, which were
      adorned with garlands, and filled with spectators; but when it
      reached the house of the sons of promotus, the principal eunuch
      respectfully entered the mansion, invested the fair eudoxia with
      the imperial robes, and conducted her in triumph to the palace
      and bed of arcadius. 15 the secrecy and success with which this
      conspiracy against rufinus had been conducted, imprinted a mark
      of indelible ridicule on the character of a minister, who had
      suffered himself to be deceived, in a post where the arts of
      deceit and dissimulation constitute the most distinguished merit.
      he considered, with a mixture of indignation and fear, the
      victory of an aspiring eunuch, who had secretly captivated the
      favor of his sovereign; and the disgrace of his daughter, whose
      interest was inseparably connected with his own, wounded the
      tenderness, or, at least, the pride of rufinus. at the moment
      when he flattered himself that he should become the father of a
      line of kings, a foreign maid, who had been educated in the house
      of his implacable enemies, was introduced into the imperial bed;
      and eudoxia soon displayed a superiority of sense and spirit, to
      improve the ascendant which her beauty must acquire over the mind
      of a fond and youthful husband. the emperor would soon be
      instructed to hate, to fear, and to destroy the powerful subject,
      whom he had injured; and the consciousness of guilt deprived
      rufinus of every hope, either of safety or comfort, in the
      retirement of a private life. but he still possessed the most
      effectual means of defending his dignity, and perhaps of
      oppressing his enemies. the prfect still exercised an
      uncontrolled authority over the civil and military government of
      the east; and his treasures, if he could resolve to use them,
      might be employed to procure proper instruments for the execution
      of the blackest designs, that pride, ambition, and revenge could
      suggest to a desperate statesman. the character of rufinus seemed
      to justify the accusations that he conspired against the person
      of his sovereign, to seat himself on the vacant throne; and that
      he had secretly invited the huns and the goths to invade the
      provinces of the empire, and to increase the public confusion.
      the subtle prfect, whose life had been spent in the intrigues
      of the palace, opposed, with equal arms, the artful measures of
      the eunuch eutropius; but the timid soul of rufinus was
      astonished by the hostile approach of a more formidable rival, of
      the great stilicho, the general, or rather the master, of the
      empire of the west. 16

      the celestial gift, which achilles obtained, and alexander
      envied, of a poet worthy to celebrate the actions of heroes has
      been enjoyed by stilicho, in a much higher degree than might have
      been expected from the declining state of genius, and of art. the
      muse of claudian, 17 devoted to his service, was always prepared
      to stigmatize his adversaries, rufinus, or eutropius, with
      eternal infamy; or to paint, in the most splendid colors, the
      victories and virtues of a powerful benefactor. in the review of
      a period indifferently supplied with authentic materials, we
      cannot refuse to illustrate the annals of honorius, from the
      invectives, or the panegyrics, of a contemporary writer; but as
      claudian appears to have indulged the most ample privilege of a
      poet and a courtier, some criticism will be requisite to
      translate the language of fiction or exaggeration, into the truth
      and simplicity of historic prose. his silence concerning the
      family of stilicho may be admitted as a proof, that his patron
      was neither able, nor desirous, to boast of a long series of
      illustrious progenitors; and the slight mention of his father, an
      officer of barbarian cavalry in the service of valens, seems to
      countenance the assertion, that the general, who so long
      commanded the armies of rome, was descended from the savage and
      perfidious race of the vandals. 18 if stilicho had not possessed
      the external advantages of strength and stature, the most
      flattering bard, in the presence of so many thousand spectators,
      would have hesitated to affirm, that he surpassed the measure of
      the demi-gods of antiquity; and that whenever he moved, with
      lofty steps, through the streets of the capital, the astonished
      crowd made room for the stranger, who displayed, in a private
      condition, the awful majesty of a hero. from his earliest youth
      he embraced the profession of arms; his prudence and valor were
      soon distinguished in the field; the horsemen and archers of the
      east admired his superior dexterity; and in each degree of his
      military promotions, the public judgment always prevented and
      approved the choice of the sovereign. he was named, by
      theodosius, to ratify a solemn treaty with the monarch of persia;
      he supported, during that important embassy, the dignity of the
      roman name; and after he returned to constantinople, his merit
      was rewarded by an intimate and honorable alliance with the
      imperial family. theodosius had been prompted, by a pious motive
      of fraternal affection, to adopt, for his own, the daughter of
      his brother honorius; the beauty and accomplishments of serena 19
      were universally admired by the obsequious court; and stilicho
      obtained the preference over a crowd of rivals, who ambitiously
      disputed the hand of the princess, and the favor of her adopted
      father. 20 the assurance that the husband of serena would be
      faithful to the throne, which he was permitted to approach,
      engaged the emperor to exalt the fortunes, and to employ the
      abilities, of the sagacious and intrepid stilicho. he rose,
      through the successive steps of master of the horse, and count of
      the domestics, to the supreme rank of master-general of all the
      cavalry and infantry of the roman, or at least of the western,
      empire; 21 and his enemies confessed, that he invariably
      disdained to barter for gold the rewards of merit, or to defraud
      the soldiers of the pay and gratifications which they deserved or
      claimed, from the liberality of the state. 22 the valor and
      conduct which he afterwards displayed, in the defence of italy,
      against the arms of alaric and radagaisus, may justify the fame
      of his early achievements and in an age less attentive to the
      laws of honor, or of pride, the roman generals might yield the
      preeminence of rank, to the ascendant of superior genius. 23 he
      lamented, and revenged, the murder of promotus, his rival and his
      friend; and the massacre of many thousands of the flying
      bastarnae is represented by the poet as a bloody sacrifice, which
      the roman achilles offered to the manes of another patroclus. the
      virtues and victories of stilicho deserved the hatred of rufinus:
      and the arts of calumny might have been successful if the tender
      and vigilant serena had not protected her husband against his
      domestic foes, whilst he vanquished in the field the enemies of
      the empire. 24 theodosius continued to support an unworthy
      minister, to whose diligence he delegated the government of the
      palace, and of the east; but when he marched against the tyrant
      eugenius, he associated his faithful general to the labors and
      glories of the civil war; and in the last moments of his life,
      the dying monarch recommended to stilicho the care of his sons,
      and of the republic. 25 the ambition and the abilities of
      stilicho were not unequal to the important trust; and he claimed
      the guardianship of the two empires, during the minority of
      arcadius and honorius. 26 the first measure of his
      administration, or rather of his reign, displayed to the nations
      the vigor and activity of a spirit worthy to command. he passed
      the alps in the depth of winter; descended the stream of the
      rhine, from the fortress of basil to the marshes of batavia;
      reviewed the state of the garrisons; repressed the enterprises of
      the germans; and, after establishing along the banks a firm and
      honorable peace, returned, with incredible speed, to the palace
      of milan. 27 the person and court of honorius were subject to the
      master-general of the west; and the armies and provinces of
      europe obeyed, without hesitation, a regular authority, which was
      exercised in the name of their young sovereign. two rivals only
      remained to dispute the claims, and to provoke the vengeance, of
      stilicho. within the limits of africa, gildo, the moor,
      maintained a proud and dangerous independence; and the minister
      of constantinople asserted his equal reign over the emperor, and
      the empire, of the east.

      chapter xxix: division of roman empire between sons of
      theodosius.part ii.

      the impartiality which stilicho affected, as the common guardian
      of the royal brothers, engaged him to regulate the equal division
      of the arms, the jewels, and the magnificent wardrobe and
      furniture of the deceased emperor. 28 but the most important
      object of the inheritance consisted of the numerous legions,
      cohorts, and squadrons, of romans, or barbarians, whom the event
      of the civil war had united under the standard of theodosius. the
      various multitudes of europe and asia, exasperated by recent
      animosities, were overawed by the authority of a single man; and
      the rigid discipline of stilicho protected the lands of the
      citizens from the rapine of the licentious soldier. 29 anxious,
      however, and impatient, to relieve italy from the presence of
      this formidable host, which could be useful only on the frontiers
      of the empire, he listened to the just requisition of the
      minister of arcadius, declared his intention of reconducting in
      person the troops of the east, and dexterously employed the rumor
      of a gothic tumult to conceal his private designs of ambition and
      revenge. 30 the guilty soul of rufinus was alarmed by the
      approach of a warrior and a rival, whose enmity he deserved; he
      computed, with increasing terror, the narrow space of his life
      and greatness; and, as the last hope of safety, he interposed the
      authority of the emperor arcadius. stilicho, who appears to have
      directed his march along the sea-coast of the adriatic, was not
      far distant from the city of thessalonica, when he received a
      peremptory message, to recall the troops of the east, and to
      declare, that his nearer approach would be considered, by the
      byzantine court, as an act of hostility. the prompt and
      unexpected obedience of the general of the west, convinced the
      vulgar of his loyalty and moderation; and, as he had already
      engaged the affection of the eastern troops, he recommended to
      their zeal the execution of his bloody design, which might be
      accomplished in his absence, with less danger, perhaps, and with
      less reproach. stilicho left the command of the troops of the
      east to gainas, the goth, on whose fidelity he firmly relied,
      with an assurance, at least, that the hardy barbarians would
      never be diverted from his purpose by any consideration of fear
      or remorse. the soldiers were easily persuaded to punish the
      enemy of stilicho and of rome; and such was the general hatred
      which rufinus had excited, that the fatal secret, communicated to
      thousands, was faithfully preserved during the long march from
      thessalonica to the gates of constantinople. as soon as they had
      resolved his death, they condescended to flatter his pride; the
      ambitious prfect was seduced to believe, that those powerful
      auxiliaries might be tempted to place the diadem on his head; and
      the treasures which he distributed, with a tardy and reluctant
      hand, were accepted by the indignant multitude as an insult,
      rather than as a gift. at the distance of a mile from the
      capital, in the field of mars, before the palace of hebdomon, the
      troops halted: and the emperor, as well as his minister,
      advanced, according to ancient custom, respectfully to salute the
      power which supported their throne. as rufinus passed along the
      ranks, and disguised, with studied courtesy, his innate
      haughtiness, the wings insensibly wheeled from the right and
      left, and enclosed the devoted victim within the circle of their
      arms. before he could reflect on the danger of his situation,
      gainas gave the signal of death; a daring and forward soldier
      plunged his sword into the breast of the guilty prfect, and
      rufinus fell, groaned, and expired, at the feet of the affrighted
      emperor. if the agonies of a moment could expiate the crimes of a
      whole life, or if the outrages inflicted on a breathless corpse
      could be the object of pity, our humanity might perhaps be
      affected by the horrid circumstances which accompanied the murder
      of rufinus. his mangled body was abandoned to the brutal fury of
      the populace of either sex, who hastened in crowds, from every
      quarter of the city, to trample on the remains of the haughty
      minister, at whose frown they had so lately trembled. his right
      hand was cut off, and carried through the streets of
      constantinople, in cruel mockery, to extort contributions for the
      avaricious tyrant, whose head was publicly exposed, borne aloft
      on the point of a long lance. 31 according to the savage maxims
      of the greek republics, his innocent family would have shared the
      punishment of his crimes. the wife and daughter of rufinus were
      indebted for their safety to the influence of religion. her
      sanctuary protected them from the raging madness of the people;
      and they were permitted to spend the remainder of their lives in
      the exercise of christian devotions, in the peaceful retirement
      of jerusalem. 32

      the servile poet of stilicho applauds, with ferocious joy, this
      horrid deed, which, in the execution, perhaps, of justice,
      violated every law of nature and society, profaned the majesty of
      the prince, and renewed the dangerous examples of military
      license. the contemplation of the universal order and harmony had
      satisfied claudian of the existence of the deity; but the
      prosperous impunity of vice appeared to contradict his moral
      attributes; and the fate of rufinus was the only event which
      could dispel the religious doubts of the poet. 33 such an act
      might vindicate the honor of providence, but it did not much
      contribute to the happiness of the people. in less than three
      months they were informed of the maxims of the new
      administration, by a singular edict, which established the
      exclusive right of the treasury over the spoils of rufinus; and
      silenced, under heavy penalties, the presumptuous claims of the
      subjects of the eastern empire, who had been injured by his
      rapacious tyranny. 34 even stilicho did not derive from the
      murder of his rival the fruit which he had proposed; and though
      he gratified his revenge, his ambition was disappointed. under
      the name of a favorite, the weakness of arcadius required a
      master, but he naturally preferred the obsequious arts of the
      eunuch eutropius, who had obtained his domestic confidence: and
      the emperor contemplated, with terror and aversion, the stern
      genius of a foreign warrior. till they were divided by the
      jealousy of power, the sword of gainas, and the charms of
      eudoxia, supported the favor of the great chamberlain of the
      palace: the perfidious goth, who was appointed master-general of
      the east, betrayed, without scruple, the interest of his
      benefactor; and the same troops, who had so lately massacred the
      enemy of stilicho, were engaged to support, against him, the
      independence of the throne of constantinople. the favorites of
      arcadius fomented a secret and irreconcilable war against a
      formidable hero, who aspired to govern, and to defend, the two
      empires of rome, and the two sons of theodosius. they incessantly
      labored, by dark and treacherous machinations, to deprive him of
      the esteem of the prince, the respect of the people, and the
      friendship of the barbarians. the life of stilicho was repeatedly
      attempted by the dagger of hired assassins; and a decree was
      obtained from the senate of constantinople, to declare him an
      enemy of the republic, and to confiscate his ample possessions in
      the provinces of the east. at a time when the only hope of
      delaying the ruin of the roman name depended on the firm union,
      and reciprocal aid, of all the nations to whom it had been
      gradually communicated, the subjects of arcadius and honorius
      were instructed, by their respective masters, to view each other
      in a foreign, and even hostile, light; to rejoice in their mutual
      calamities, and to embrace, as their faithful allies, the
      barbarians, whom they excited to invade the territories of their
      countrymen. 35 the natives of italy affected to despise the
      servile and effeminate greeks of byzantium, who presumed to
      imitate the dress, and to usurp the dignity, of roman senators;
      36 and the greeks had not yet forgot the sentiments of hatred and
      contempt, which their polished ancestors had so long entertained
      for the rude inhabitants of the west. the distinction of two
      governments, which soon produced the separation of two nations,
      will justify my design of suspending the series of the byzantine
      history, to prosecute, without interruption, the disgraceful, but
      memorable, reign of honorius.

      it is curious to observe the first symptoms of jealousy and
      schism between old and new rome, between the greeks and latins.]

      the prudent stilicho, instead of persisting to force the
      inclinations of a prince, and people, who rejected his
      government, wisely abandoned arcadius to his unworthy favorites;
      and his reluctance to involve the two empires in a civil war
      displayed the moderation of a minister, who had so often
      signalized his military spirit and abilities. but if stilicho had
      any longer endured the revolt of africa, he would have betrayed
      the security of the capital, and the majesty of the western
      emperor, to the capricious insolence of a moorish rebel. gildo,
      37 the brother of the tyrant firmus, had preserved and obtained,
      as the reward of his apparent fidelity, the immense patrimony
      which was forfeited by treason: long and meritorious service, in
      the armies of rome, raised him to the dignity of a military
      count; the narrow policy of the court of theodosius had adopted
      the mischievous expedient of supporting a legal government by the
      interest of a powerful family; and the brother of firmus was
      invested with the command of africa. his ambition soon usurped
      the administration of justice, and of the finances, without
      account, and without control; and he maintained, during a reign
      of twelve years, the possession of an office, from which it was
      impossible to remove him, without the danger of a civil war.
      during those twelve years, the provinces of africa groaned under
      the dominion of a tyrant, who seemed to unite the unfeeling
      temper of a stranger with the partial resentments of domestic
      faction. the forms of law were often superseded by the use of
      poison; and if the trembling guests, who were invited to the
      table of gildo, presumed to express fears, the insolent suspicion
      served only to excite his fury, and he loudly summoned the
      ministers of death. gildo alternately indulged the passions of
      avarice and lust; 38 and if his days were terrible to the rich,
      his nights were not less dreadful to husbands and parents. the
      fairest of their wives and daughters were prostituted to the
      embraces of the tyrant; and afterwards abandoned to a ferocious
      troop of barbarians and assassins, the black, or swarthy, natives
      of the desert; whom gildo considered as the only guardians of his
      throne. in the civil war between theodosius and eugenius, the
      count, or rather the sovereign, of africa, maintained a haughty
      and suspicious neutrality; refused to assist either of the
      contending parties with troops or vessels, expected the
      declaration of fortune, and reserved for the conqueror the vain
      professions of his allegiance. such professions would not have
      satisfied the master of the roman world; but the death of
      theodosius, and the weakness and discord of his sons, confirmed
      the power of the moor; who condescended, as a proof of his
      moderation, to abstain from the use of the diadem, and to supply
      rome with the customary tribute, or rather subsidy, of corn. in
      every division of the empire, the five provinces of africa were
      invariably assigned to the west; and gildo had to govern that
      extensive country in the name of honorius, but his knowledge of
      the character and designs of stilicho soon engaged him to address
      his homage to a more distant and feeble sovereign. the ministers
      of arcadius embraced the cause of a perfidious rebel; and the
      delusive hope of adding the numerous cities of africa to the
      empire of the east, tempted them to assert a claim, which they
      were incapable of supporting, either by reason or by arms. 39

      claudian (de bell. gildonico, 230-324) has touched, with
      political delicacy, the intrigues of the byzantine court, which
      are likewise mentioned by zosimus, (l. v. p. 302.)]

      when stilicho had given a firm and decisive answer to the
      pretensions of the byzantine court, he solemnly accused the
      tyrant of africa before the tribunal, which had formerly judged
      the kings and nations of the earth; and the image of the republic
      was revived, after a long interval, under the reign of honorius.
      the emperor transmitted an accurate and ample detail of the
      complaints of the provincials, and the crimes of gildo, to the
      roman senate; and the members of that venerable assembly were
      required to pronounce the condemnation of the rebel. their
      unanimous suffrage declared him the enemy of the republic; and
      the decree of the senate added a sacred and legitimate sanction
      to the roman arms. 40 a people, who still remembered that their
      ancestors had been the masters of the world, would have
      applauded, with conscious pride, the representation of ancient
      freedom; if they had not since been accustomed to prefer the
      solid assurance of bread to the unsubstantial visions of liberty
      and greatness. the subsistence of rome depended on the harvests
      of africa; and it was evident, that a declaration of war would be
      the signal of famine. the prfect symmachus, who presided in the
      deliberations of the senate, admonished the minister of his just
      apprehension, that as soon as the revengeful moor should prohibit
      the exportation of corn, tranquility and perhaps the safety, of
      the capital would be threatened by the hungry rage of a turbulent
      multitude. 41 the prudence of stilicho conceived and executed,
      without delay, the most effectual measure for the relief of the
      roman people. a large and seasonable supply of corn, collected in
      the inland provinces of gaul, was embarked on the rapid stream of
      the rhone, and transported, by an easy navigation, from the rhone
      to the tyber. during the whole term of the african war, the
      granaries of rome were continually filled, her dignity was
      vindicated from the humiliating dependence, and the minds of an
      immense people were quieted by the calm confidence of peace and
      plenty. 42

      his private injuries on the head of the tyrant. the spirit of
      discord which prevailed in the house of nabal, had excited a
      deadly quarrel between two of his sons, gildo and mascezel. 43
      the usurper pursued, with implacable rage, the life of his
      younger brother, whose courage and abilities he feared; and
      mascezel, oppressed by superior power, took refuge in the court
      of milan, where he soon received the cruel intelligence that his
      two innocent and helpless children had been murdered by their
      inhuman uncle. the affliction of the father was suspended only by
      the desire of revenge. the vigilant stilicho already prepared to
      collect the naval and military force of the western empire; and
      he had resolved, if the tyrant should be able to wage an equal
      and doubtful war, to march against him in person. but as italy
      required his presence, and as it might be dangerous to weaken the
      defence of the frontier, he judged it more advisable, that
      mascezel should attempt this arduous adventure at the head of a
      chosen body of gallic veterans, who had lately served under the
      standard of eugenius. these troops, who were exhorted to convince
      the world that they could subvert, as well as defend the throne
      of a usurper, consisted of the jovian, the herculian, and the
      augustan legions; of the nervian auxiliaries; of the soldiers who
      displayed in their banners the symbol of a lion, and of the
      troops which were distinguished by the auspicious names of
      fortunate, and invincible. yet such was the smallness of their
      establishments, or the difficulty of recruiting, that these seven
      bands, 44 of high dignity and reputation in the service of rome,
      amounted to no more than five thousand effective men. 45 the
      fleet of galleys and transports sailed in tempestuous weather
      from the port of pisa, in tuscany, and steered their course to
      the little island of capraria; which had borrowed that name from
      the wild goats, its original inhabitants, whose place was
      occupied by a new colony of a strange and savage appearance. the
      whole island (says an ingenious traveller of those times) is
      filled, or rather defiled, by men who fly from the light. they
      call themselves monks, or solitaries, because they choose to live
      alone, without any witnesses of their actions. they fear the
      gifts of fortune, from the apprehension of losing them; and, lest
      they should be miserable, they embrace a life of voluntary
      wretchedness. how absurd is their choice! how perverse their
      understanding! to dread the evils, without being able to support
      the blessings, of the human condition. either this melancholy
      madness is the effect of disease, or exercise on their own bodies
      the tortures which are inflicted on fugitive slaves by the hand
      of justice. 46 such was the contempt of a profane magistrate for
      the monks as the chosen servants of god. 47 some of them were
      persuaded, by his entreaties, to embark on board the fleet; and
      it is observed, to the praise of the roman general, that his days
      and nights were employed in prayer, fasting, and the occupation
      of singing psalms. the devout leader, who, with such a
      reenforcement, appeared confident of victory, avoided the
      dangerous rocks of corsica, coasted along the eastern side of
      sardinia, and secured his ships against the violence of the south
      wind, by casting anchor in the and capacious harbor of cagliari,
      at the distance of one hundred and forty miles from the african
      shores. 48

      gildo was prepared to resist the invasion with all the forces of
      africa. by the liberality of his gifts and promises, he
      endeavored to secure the doubtful allegiance of the roman
      soldiers, whilst he attracted to his standard the distant tribes
      of gaetulia and thiopia. he proudly reviewed an army of seventy
      thousand men, and boasted, with the rash presumption which is the
      forerunner of disgrace, that his numerous cavalry would trample
      under their horses feet the troops of mascezel, and involve, in
      a cloud of burning sand, the natives of the cold regions of gaul
      and germany. 49 but the moor, who commanded the legions of
      honorius, was too well acquainted with the manners of his
      countrymen, to entertain any serious apprehension of a naked and
      disorderly host of barbarians; whose left arm, instead of a
      shield, was protected only by mantle; who were totally disarmed
      as soon as they had darted their javelin from their right hand;
      and whose horses had never been in combat. he fixed his camp of
      five thousand veterans in the face of a superior enemy, and,
      after the delay of three days, gave the signal of a general
      engagement. 50 as mascezel advanced before the front with fair
      offers of peace and pardon, he encountered one of the foremost
      standard-bearers of the africans, and, on his refusal to yield,
      struck him on the arm with his sword. the arm, and the standard,
      sunk under the weight of the blow; and the imaginary act of
      submission was hastily repeated by all the standards of the line.
      at this the disaffected cohorts proclaimed the name of their
      lawful sovereign; the barbarians, astonished by the defection of
      their roman allies, dispersed, according to their custom, in
      tumultuary flight; and mascezel obtained honors the of an easy,
      and almost bloodless, victory. 51 the tyrant escaped from the
      field of battle to the sea-shore; and threw himself into a small
      vessel, with the hope of reaching in safety some friendly port of
      the empire of the east; but the obstinacy of the wind drove him
      back into the harbor of tabraca, 52 which had acknowledged, with
      the rest of the province, the dominion of honorius, and the
      authority of his lieutenant. the inhabitants, as a proof of their
      repentance and loyalty, seized and confined the person of gildo
      in a dungeon; and his own despair saved him from the intolerable
      torture of supporting the presence of an injured and victorious
      brother. 53 the captives and the spoils of africa were laid at
      the feet of the emperor; but stilicho, whose moderation appeared
      more conspicuous and more sincere, in the midst of prosperity,
      still affected to consult the laws of the republic; and referred
      to the senate and people of rome the judgment of the most
      illustrious criminals. 54 their trial was public and solemn; but
      the judges, in the exercise of this obsolete and precarious
      jurisdiction, were impatient to punish the african magistrates,
      who had intercepted the subsistence of the roman people. the rich
      and guilty province was oppressed by the imperial ministers, who
      had a visible interest to multiply the number of the accomplices
      of gildo; and if an edict of honorius seems to check the
      malicious industry of informers, a subsequent edict, at the
      distance of ten years, continues and renews the prosecution of
      the offences which had been committed in the time of the general
      rebellion. 55 the adherents of the tyrant who escaped the first
      fury of the soldiers, and the judges, might derive some
      consolation from the tragic fate of his brother, who could never
      obtain his pardon for the extraordinary services which he had
      performed. after he had finished an important war in the space of
      a single winter, mascezel was received at the court of milan with
      loud applause, affected gratitude, and secret jealousy; 56 and
      his death, which, perhaps, was the effect of passage of a bridge,
      the moorish prince, who accompanied the master-general of the
      west, was suddenly thrown from his horse into the river; the
      officious haste of the attendants was restrained by a cruel and
      perfidious smile which they observed on the countenance of
      stilicho; and while they delayed the necessary assistance, the
      unfortunate mascezel was irrecoverably drowned. 57

      right of sanctuary.]

      the joy of the african triumph was happily connected with the
      nuptials of the emperor honorius, and of his cousin maria, the
      daughter of stilicho: and this equal and honorable alliance
      seemed to invest the powerful minister with the authority of a
      parent over his submissive pupil. the muse of claudian was not
      silent on this propitious day; 58 he sung, in various and lively
      strains, the happiness of the royal pair; and the glory of the
      hero, who confirmed their union, and supported their throne. the
      ancient fables of greece, which had almost ceased to be the
      object of religious faith, were saved from oblivion by the genius
      of poetry. the picture of the cyprian grove, the seat of harmony
      and love; the triumphant progress of venus over her native seas,
      and the mild influence which her presence diffused in the palace
      of milan, express to every age the natural sentiments of the
      heart, in the just and pleasing language of allegorical fiction.
      but the amorous impatience which claudian attributes to the young
      prince, 59 must excite the smiles of the court; and his beauteous
      spouse (if she deserved the praise of beauty) had not much to
      fear or to hope from the passions of her lover. honorius was only
      in the fourteenth year of his age; serena, the mother of his
      bride, deferred, by art of persuasion, the consummation of the
      royal nuptials; maria died a virgin, after she had been ten years
      a wife; and the chastity of the emperor was secured by the
      coldness, or perhaps, the debility, of his constitution. 60 his
      subjects, who attentively studied the character of their young
      sovereign, discovered that honorius was without passions, and
      consequently without talents; and that his feeble and languid
      disposition was alike incapable of discharging the duties of his
      rank, or of enjoying the pleasures of his age. in his early youth
      he made some progress in the exercises of riding and drawing the
      bow: but he soon relinquished these fatiguing occupations, and
      the amusement of feeding poultry became the serious and daily
      care of the monarch of the west, 61 who resigned the reins of
      empire to the firm and skilful hand of his guardian stilicho. the
      experience of history will countenance the suspicion that a
      prince who was born in the purple, received a worse education
      than the meanest peasant of his dominions; and that the ambitious
      minister suffered him to attain the age of manhood, without
      attempting to excite his courage, or to enlighten his
      understanding. 62 the predecessors of honorius were accustomed to
      animate by their example, or at least by their presence, the
      valor of the legions; and the dates of their laws attest the
      perpetual activity of their motions through the provinces of the
      roman world. but the son of theodosius passed the slumber of his
      life, a captive in his palace, a stranger in his country, and the
      patient, almost the indifferent, spectator of the ruin of the
      western empire, which was repeatedly attacked, and finally
      subverted, by the arms of the barbarians. in the eventful history
      of a reign of twenty-eight years, it will seldom be necessary to
      mention the name of the emperor honorius.

      if the subjects of rome could be ignorant of their obligations to
      the great theodosius, they were too soon convinced, how painfully
      the spirit and abilities of their deceased emperor had supported
      the frail and mouldering edifice of the republic. he died in the
      month of january; and before the end of the winter of the same
      year, the gothic nation was in arms. 1 the barbarian auxiliaries
      erected their independent standard; and boldly avowed the hostile
      designs, which they had long cherished in their ferocious minds.
      their countrymen, who had been condemned, by the conditions of
      the last treaty, to a life of tranquility and labor, deserted
      their farms at the first sound of the trumpet; and eagerly
      resumed the weapons which they had reluctantly laid down. the
      barriers of the danube were thrown open; the savage warriors of
      scythia issued from their forests; and the uncommon severity of
      the winter allowed the poet to remark, that they rolled their
      ponderous wagons over the broad and icy back of the indignant
      river. 2 the unhappy natives of the provinces to the south of
      the danube submitted to the calamities, which, in the course of
      twenty years, were almost grown familiar to their imagination;
      and the various troops of barbarians, who gloried in the gothic
      name, were irregularly spread from woody shores of dalmatia, to
      the walls of constantinople. 3 the interruption, or at least the
      diminution, of the subsidy, which the goths had received from the
      prudent liberality of theodosius, was the specious pretence of
      their revolt: the affront was imbittered by their contempt for
      the unwarlike sons of theodosius; and their resentment was
      inflamed by the weakness, or treachery, of the minister of
      arcadius. the frequent visits of rufinus to the camp of the
      barbarians whose arms and apparel he affected to imitate, were
      considered as a sufficient evidence of his guilty correspondence,
      and the public enemy, from a motive either of gratitude or of
      policy, was attentive, amidst the general devastation, to spare
      the private estates of the unpopular prfect. the goths, instead
      of being impelled by the blind and headstrong passions of their
      chiefs, were now directed by the bold and artful genius of
      alaric. that renowned leader was descended from the noble race of
      the balti; 4 which yielded only to the royal dignity of the
      amali: he had solicited the command of the roman armies; and the
      imperial court provoked him to demonstrate the folly of their
      refusal, and the importance of their loss. whatever hopes might
      be entertained of the conquest of constantinople, the judicious
      general soon abandoned an impracticable enterprise. in the midst
      of a divided court and a discontented people, the emperor
      arcadius was terrified by the aspect of the gothic arms; but the
      want of wisdom and valor was supplied by the strength of the
      city; and the fortifications, both of the sea and land, might
      securely brave the impotent and random darts of the barbarians.
      alaric disdained to trample any longer on the prostrate and
      ruined countries of thrace and dacia, and he resolved to seek a
      plentiful harvest of fame and riches in a province which had
      hitherto escaped the ravages of war. 5

      the character of the civil and military officers, on whom rufinus
      had devolved the government of greece, confirmed the public
      suspicion, that he had betrayed the ancient seat of freedom and
      learning to the gothic invader. the proconsul antiochus was the
      unworthy son of a respectable father; and gerontius, who
      commanded the provincial troops, was much better qualified to
      execute the oppressive orders of a tyrant, than to defend, with
      courage and ability, a country most remarkably fortified by the
      hand of nature. alaric had traversed, without resistance, the
      plains of macedonia and thessaly, as far as the foot of mount
      oeta, a steep and woody range of hills, almost impervious to his
      cavalry. they stretched from east to west, to the edge of the
      sea-shore; and left, between the precipice and the malian gulf,
      an interval of three hundred feet, which, in some places, was
      contracted to a road capable of admitting only a single carriage.
      6 in this narrow pass of thermopylae, where leonidas and the
      three hundred spartans had gloriously devoted their lives, the
      goths might have been stopped, or destroyed, by a skilful
      general; and perhaps the view of that sacred spot might have
      kindled some sparks of military ardor in the breasts of the
      degenerate greeks. the troops which had been posted to defend the
      straits of thermopylae, retired, as they were directed, without
      attempting to disturb the secure and rapid passage of alaric; 7
      and the fertile fields of phocis and boeotia were instantly
      covered by a deluge of barbarians who massacred the males of an
      age to bear arms, and drove away the beautiful females, with the
      spoil and cattle of the flaming villages. the travellers, who
      visited greece several years afterwards, could easily discover
      the deep and bloody traces of the march of the goths; and thebes
      was less indebted for her preservation to the strength of her
      seven gates, than to the eager haste of alaric, who advanced to
      occupy the city of athens, and the important harbor of the
      piraeus. the same impatience urged him to prevent the delay and
      danger of a siege, by the offer of a capitulation; and as soon as
      the athenians heard the voice of the gothic herald, they were
      easily persuaded to deliver the greatest part of their wealth, as
      the ransom of the city of minerva and its inhabitants. the treaty
      was ratified by solemn oaths, and observed with mutual fidelity.
      the gothic prince, with a small and select train, was admitted
      within the walls; he indulged himself in the refreshment of the
      bath, accepted a splendid banquet, which was provided by the
      magistrate, and affected to show that he was not ignorant of the
      manners of civilized nations. 8 but the whole territory of
      attica, from the promontory of sunium to the town of megara, was
      blasted by his baleful presence; and, if we may use the
      comparison of a contemporary philosopher, athens itself resembled
      the bleeding and empty skin of a slaughtered victim. the distance
      between megara and corinth could not much exceed thirty miles;
      but the bad road, an expressive name, which it still bears among
      the greeks, was, or might easily have been made, impassable for
      the march of an enemy. the thick and gloomy woods of mount
      cithaeron covered the inland country; the scironian rocks
      approached the waters edge, and hung over the narrow and winding
      path, which was confined above six miles along the sea-shore. 9
      the passage of those rocks, so infamous in every age, was
      terminated by the isthmus of corinth; and a small a body of firm
      and intrepid soldiers might have successfully defended a
      temporary intrenchment of five or six miles from the ionian to
      the aegean sea. the confidence of the cities of peloponnesus in
      their natural rampart, had tempted them to neglect the care of
      their antique walls; and the avarice of the roman governors had
      exhausted and betrayed the unhappy province. 10 corinth, argos,
      sparta, yielded without resistance to the arms of the goths; and
      the most fortunate of the inhabitants were saved, by death, from
      beholding the slavery of their families and the conflagration of
      their cities. 11 the vases and statues were distributed among the
      barbarians, with more regard to the value of the materials, than
      to the elegance of the workmanship; the female captives submitted
      to the laws of war; the enjoyment of beauty was the reward of
      valor; and the greeks could not reasonably complain of an abuse
      which was justified by the example of the heroic times. 12 the
      descendants of that extraordinary people, who had considered
      valor and discipline as the walls of sparta, no longer remembered
      the generous reply of their ancestors to an invader more
      formidable than alaric. if thou art a god, thou wilt not hurt
      those who have never injured thee; if thou art a man,
      advance:and thou wilt find men equal to thyself. 13 from
      thermopylae to sparta, the leader of the goths pursued his
      victorious march without encountering any mortal antagonists: but
      one of the advocates of expiring paganism has confidently
      asserted, that the walls of athens were guarded by the goddess
      minerva, with her formidable aegis, and by the angry phantom of
      achilles; 14 and that the conqueror was dismayed by the presence
      of the hostile deities of greece. in an age of miracles, it would
      perhaps be unjust to dispute the claim of the historian zosimus
      to the common benefit: yet it cannot be dissembled, that the mind
      of alaric was ill prepared to receive, either in sleeping or
      waking visions, the impressions of greek superstition. the songs
      of homer, and the fame of achilles, had probably never reached
      the ear of the illiterate barbarian; and the christian faith,
      which he had devoutly embraced, taught him to despise the
      imaginary deities of rome and athens. the invasion of the goths,
      instead of vindicating the honor, contributed, at least
      accidentally, to extirpate the last remains of paganism: and the
      mysteries of ceres, which had subsisted eighteen hundred years,
      did not survive the destruction of eleusis, and the calamities of
      greece. 15

      the last hope of a people who could no longer depend on their
      arms, their gods, or their sovereign, was placed in the powerful
      assistance of the general of the west; and stilicho, who had not
      been permitted to repulse, advanced to chastise, the invaders of
      greece. 16 a numerous fleet was equipped in the ports of italy;
      and the troops, after a short and prosperous navigation over the
      ionian sea, were safely disembarked on the isthmus, near the
      ruins of corinth. the woody and mountainous country of arcadia,
      the fabulous residence of pan and the dryads, became the scene of
      a long and doubtful conflict between the two generals not
      unworthy of each other. the skill and perseverance of the roman
      at length prevailed; and the goths, after sustaining a
      considerable loss from disease and desertion, gradually retreated
      to the lofty mountain of pholoe, near the sources of the peneus,
      and on the frontiers of elis; a sacred country, which had
      formerly been exempted from the calamities of war. 17 the camp of
      the barbarians was immediately besieged; the waters of the river
      18 were diverted into another channel; and while they labored
      under the intolerable pressure of thirst and hunger, a strong
      line of circumvallation was formed to prevent their escape. after
      these precautions, stilicho, too confident of victory, retired to
      enjoy his triumph, in the theatrical games, and lascivious
      dances, of the greeks; his soldiers, deserting their standards,
      spread themselves over the country of their allies, which they
      stripped of all that had been saved from the rapacious hands of
      the enemy. alaric appears to have seized the favorable moment to
      execute one of those hardy enterprises, in which the abilities of
      a general are displayed with more genuine lustre, than in the
      tumult of a day of battle. to extricate himself from the prison
      of peloponnesus, it was necessary that he should pierce the
      intrenchments which surrounded his camp; that he should perform a
      difficult and dangerous march of thirty miles, as far as the gulf
      of corinth; and that he should transport his troops, his
      captives, and his spoil, over an arm of the sea, which, in the
      narrow interval between rhium and the opposite shore, is at least
      half a mile in breadth. 19 the operations of alaric must have
      been secret, prudent, and rapid; since the roman general was
      confounded by the intelligence, that the goths, who had eluded
      his efforts, were in full possession of the important province of
      epirus. this unfortunate delay allowed alaric sufficient time to
      conclude the treaty, which he secretly negotiated, with the
      ministers of constantinople. the apprehension of a civil war
      compelled stilicho to retire, at the haughty mandate of his
      rivals, from the dominions of arcadius; and he respected, in the
      enemy of rome, the honorable character of the ally and servant of
      the emperor of the east.

      a grecian philosopher, 20 who visited constantinople soon after
      the death of theodosius, published his liberal opinions
      concerning the duties of kings, and the state of the roman
      republic. synesius observes, and deplores, the fatal abuse, which
      the imprudent bounty of the late emperor had introduced into the
      military service. the citizens and subjects had purchased an
      exemption from the indispensable duty of defending their country;
      which was supported by the arms of barbarian mercenaries. the
      fugitives of scythia were permitted to disgrace the illustrious
      dignities of the empire; their ferocious youth, who disdained the
      salutary restraint of laws, were more anxious to acquire the
      riches, than to imitate the arts, of a people, the object of
      their contempt and hatred; and the power of the goths was the
      stone of tantalus, perpetually suspended over the peace and
      safety of the devoted state. the measures which synesius
      recommends, are the dictates of a bold and generous patriot. he
      exhorts the emperor to revive the courage of his subjects, by the
      example of manly virtue; to banish luxury from the court and from
      the camp; to substitute, in the place of the barbarian
      mercenaries, an army of men, interested in the defence of their
      laws and of their property; to force, in such a moment of public
      danger, the mechanic from his shop, and the philosopher from his
      school; to rouse the indolent citizen from his dream of pleasure,
      and to arm, for the protection of agriculture, the hands of the
      laborious husbandman. at the head of such troops, who might
      deserve the name, and would display the spirit, of romans, he
      animates the son of theodosius to encounter a race of barbarians,
      who were destitute of any real courage; and never to lay down his
      arms, till he had chased them far away into the solitudes of
      scythia; or had reduced them to the state of ignominious
      servitude, which the lacedaemonians formerly imposed on the
      captive helots. 21 the court of arcadius indulged the zeal,
      applauded the eloquence, and neglected the advice, of synesius.
      perhaps the philosopher who addresses the emperor of the east in
      the language of reason and virtue, which he might have used to a
      spartan king, had not condescended to form a practicable scheme,
      consistent with the temper, and circumstances, of a degenerate
      age. perhaps the pride of the ministers, whose business was
      seldom interrupted by reflection, might reject, as wild and
      visionary, every proposal, which exceeded the measure of their
      capacity, and deviated from the forms and precedents of office.
      while the oration of synesius, and the downfall of the
      barbarians, were the topics of popular conversation, an edict was
      published at constantinople, which declared the promotion of
      alaric to the rank of master-general of the eastern illyricum.
      the roman provincials, and the allies, who had respected the
      faith of treaties, were justly indignant, that the ruin of greece
      and epirus should be so liberally rewarded. the gothic conqueror
      was received as a lawful magistrate, in the cities which he had
      so lately besieged. the fathers, whose sons he had massacred, the
      husbands, whose wives he had violated, were subject to his
      authority; and the success of his rebellion encouraged the
      ambition of every leader of the foreign mercenaries. the use to
      which alaric applied his new command, distinguishes the firm and
      judicious character of his policy. he issued his orders to the
      four magazines and manufactures of offensive and defensive arms,
      margus, ratiaria, naissus, and thessalonica, to provide his
      troops with an extraordinary supply of shields, helmets, swords,
      and spears; the unhappy provincials were compelled to forge the
      instruments of their own destruction; and the barbarians removed
      the only defect which had sometimes disappointed the efforts of
      their courage. 22 the birth of alaric, the glory of his past
      exploits, and the confidence in his future designs, insensibly
      united the body of the nation under his victorious standard; and,
      with the unanimous consent of the barbarian chieftains, the
      master-general of illyricum was elevated, according to ancient
      custom, on a shield, and solemnly proclaimed king of the
      visigoths. 23 armed with this double power, seated on the verge
      of the two empires, he alternately sold his deceitful promises to
      the courts of arcadius and honorius; till he declared and
      executed his resolution of invading the dominions of the west.
      the provinces of europe which belonged to the eastern emperor,
      were already exhausted; those of asia were inaccessible; and the
      strength of constantinople had resisted his attack. but he was
      tempted by the fame, the beauty, the wealth of italy, which he
      had twice visited; and he secretly aspired to plant the gothic
      standard on the walls of rome, and to enrich his army with the
      accumulated spoils of three hundred triumphs. 25

      but as it was not accomplished within the term which has been
      rashly fixed the interpreters escaped through an ambiguous
      meaning.]

      the scarcity of facts, 26 and the uncertainty of dates, 27 oppose
      our attempts to describe the circumstances of the first invasion
      of italy by the arms of alaric. his march, perhaps from
      thessalonica, through the warlike and hostile country of
      pannonia, as far as the foot of the julian alps; his passage of
      those mountains, which were strongly guarded by troops and
      intrenchments; the siege of aquileia, and the conquest of the
      provinces of istria and venetia, appear to have employed a
      considerable time. unless his operations were extremely cautious
      and slow, the length of the interval would suggest a probable
      suspicion, that the gothic king retreated towards the banks of
      the danube; and reenforced his army with fresh swarms of
      barbarians, before he again attempted to penetrate into the heart
      of italy. since the public and important events escape the
      diligence of the historian, he may amuse himself with
      contemplating, for a moment, the influence of the arms of alaric
      on the fortunes of two obscure individuals, a presbyter of
      aquileia and a husbandman of verona. the learned rufinus, who was
      summoned by his enemies to appear before a roman synod, 28 wisely
      preferred the dangers of a besieged city; and the barbarians, who
      furiously shook the walls of aquileia, might save him from the
      cruel sentence of another heretic, who, at the request of the
      same bishops, was severely whipped, and condemned to perpetual
      exile on a desert island. 29 the old man, 30 who had passed his
      simple and innocent life in the neighborhood of verona, was a
      stranger to the quarrels both of kings and of bishops; his
      pleasures, his desires, his knowledge, were confined within the
      little circle of his paternal farm; and a staff supported his
      aged steps, on the same ground where he had sported in his
      infancy. yet even this humble and rustic felicity (which claudian
      describes with so much truth and feeling) was still exposed to
      the undistinguishing rage of war. his trees, his old contemporary
      trees, 31 must blaze in the conflagration of the whole country; a
      detachment of gothic cavalry might sweep away his cottage and his
      family; and the power of alaric could destroy this happiness,
      which he was not able either to taste or to bestow. fame, says
      the poet, encircling with terror her gloomy wings, proclaimed
      the march of the barbarian army, and filled italy with
      consternation: the apprehensions of each individual were
      increased in just proportion to the measure of his fortune: and
      the most timid, who had already embarked their valuable effects,
      meditated their escape to the island of sicily, or the african
      coast. the public distress was aggravated by the fears and
      reproaches of superstition. 32 every hour produced some horrid
      tale of strange and portentous accidents; the pagans deplored the
      neglect of omens, and the interruption of sacrifices; but the
      christians still derived some comfort from the powerful
      intercession of the saints and martyrs. 33

      chapter xxx: revolt of the goths.part ii.

      the emperor honorius was distinguished, above his subjects, by
      the preeminence of fear, as well as of rank. the pride and luxury
      in which he was educated, had not allowed him to suspect, that
      there existed on the earth any power presumptuous enough to
      invade the repose of the successor of augustus. the arts of
      flattery concealed the impending danger, till alaric approached
      the palace of milan. but when the sound of war had awakened the
      young emperor, instead of flying to arms with the spirit, or even
      the rashness, of his age, he eagerly listened to those timid
      counsellors, who proposed to convey his sacred person, and his
      faithful attendants, to some secure and distant station in the
      provinces of gaul. stilicho alone 34 had courage and authority to
      resist his disgraceful measure, which would have abandoned rome
      and italy to the barbarians; but as the troops of the palace had
      been lately detached to the rhaetian frontier, and as the
      resource of new levies was slow and precarious, the general of
      the west could only promise, that if the court of milan would
      maintain their ground during his absence, he would soon return
      with an army equal to the encounter of the gothic king. without
      losing a moment, (while each moment was so important to the
      public safety,) stilicho hastily embarked on the larian lake,
      ascended the mountains of ice and snow, amidst the severity of an
      alpine winter, and suddenly repressed, by his unexpected
      presence, the enemy, who had disturbed the tranquillity of
      rhaetia. 35 the barbarians, perhaps some tribes of the alemanni,
      respected the firmness of a chief, who still assumed the language
      of command; and the choice which he condescended to make, of a
      select number of their bravest youth, was considered as a mark of
      his esteem and favor. the cohorts, who were delivered from the
      neighboring foe, diligently repaired to the imperial standard;
      and stilicho issued his orders to the most remote troops of the
      west, to advance, by rapid marches, to the defence of honorius
      and of italy. the fortresses of the rhine were abandoned; and the
      safety of gaul was protected only by the faith of the germans,
      and the ancient terror of the roman name. even the legion, which
      had been stationed to guard the wall of britain against the
      caledonians of the north, was hastily recalled; 36 and a numerous
      body of the cavalry of the alani was persuaded to engage in the
      service of the emperor, who anxiously expected the return of his
      general. the prudence and vigor of stilicho were conspicuous on
      this occasion, which revealed, at the same time, the weakness of
      the falling empire. the legions of rome, which had long since
      languished in the gradual decay of discipline and courage, were
      exterminated by the gothic and civil wars; and it was found
      impossible, without exhausting and exposing the provinces, to
      assemble an army for the defence of italy.

      34 (return) [ solus erat stilicho, &c., is the exclusive

      chapter xxx: revolt of the goths.part iii.

      when stilicho seemed to abandon his sovereign in the unguarded
      palace of milan, he had probably calculated the term of his
      absence, the distance of the enemy, and the obstacles that might
      retard their march. he principally depended on the rivers of
      italy, the adige, the mincius, the oglio, and the addua, which,
      in the winter or spring, by the fall of rains, or by the melting
      of the snows, are commonly swelled into broad and impetuous
      torrents. 37 but the season happened to be remarkably dry: and
      the goths could traverse, without impediment, the wide and stony
      beds, whose centre was faintly marked by the course of a shallow
      stream. the bridge and passage of the addua were secured by a
      strong detachment of the gothic army; and as alaric approached
      the walls, or rather the suburbs, of milan, he enjoyed the proud
      satisfaction of seeing the emperor of the romans fly before him.
      honorius, accompanied by a feeble train of statesmen and eunuchs,
      hastily retreated towards the alps, with a design of securing his
      person in the city of arles, which had often been the royal
      residence of his predecessors. 3711 but honorius 38 had scarcely
      passed the po, before he was overtaken by the speed of the gothic
      cavalry; 39 since the urgency of the danger compelled him to seek
      a temporary shelter within the fortifications of asta, a town of
      liguria or piemont, situate on the banks of the tanarus. 40 the
      siege of an obscure place, which contained so rich a prize, and
      seemed incapable of a long resistance, was instantly formed, and
      indefatigably pressed, by the king of the goths; and the bold
      declaration, which the emperor might afterwards make, that his
      breast had never been susceptible of fear, did not probably
      obtain much credit, even in his own court. 41 in the last, and
      almost hopeless extremity, after the barbarians had already
      proposed the indignity of a capitulation, the imperial captive
      was suddenly relieved by the fame, the approach, and at length
      the presence, of the hero, whom he had so long expected. at the
      head of a chosen and intrepid vanguard, stilicho swam the stream
      of the addua, to gain the time which he must have lost in the
      attack of the bridge; the passage of the po was an enterprise of
      much less hazard and difficulty; and the successful action, in
      which he cut his way through the gothic camp under the walls of
      asta, revived the hopes, and vindicated the honor, of rome.
      instead of grasping the fruit of his victory, the barbarian was
      gradually invested, on every side, by the troops of the west, who
      successively issued through all the passes of the alps; his
      quarters were straitened; his convoys were intercepted; and the
      vigilance of the romans prepared to form a chain of
      fortifications, and to besiege the lines of the besiegers. a
      military council was assembled of the long-haired chiefs of the
      gothic nation; of aged warriors, whose bodies were wrapped in
      furs, and whose stern countenances were marked with honorable
      wounds. they weighed the glory of persisting in their attempt
      against the advantage of securing their plunder; and they
      recommended the prudent measure of a seasonable retreat. in this
      important debate, alaric displayed the spirit of the conqueror of
      rome; and after he had reminded his countrymen of their
      achievements and of their designs, he concluded his animating
      speech by the solemn and positive assurance that he was resolved
      to find in italy either a kingdom or a grave. 42

      circumstances; and possibly not less genuine than those of livy.]

      the loose discipline of the barbarians always exposed them to the
      danger of a surprise; but, instead of choosing the dissolute
      hours of riot and intemperance, stilicho resolved to attack the
      christian goths, whilst they were devoutly employed in
      celebrating the festival of easter. 43 the execution of the
      stratagem, or, as it was termed by the clergy of the sacrilege,
      was intrusted to saul, a barbarian and a pagan, who had served,
      however, with distinguished reputation among the veteran generals
      of theodosius. the camp of the goths, which alaric had pitched in
      the neighborhood of pollentia, 44 was thrown into confusion by
      the sudden and impetuous charge of the imperial cavalry; but, in
      a few moments, the undaunted genius of their leader gave them an
      order, and a field of battle; and, as soon as they had recovered
      from their astonishment, the pious confidence, that the god of
      the christians would assert their cause, added new strength to
      their native valor. in this engagement, which was long maintained
      with equal courage and success, the chief of the alani, whose
      diminutive and savage form concealed a magnanimous soul approved
      his suspected loyalty, by the zeal with which he fought, and
      fell, in the service of the republic; and the fame of this
      gallant barbarian has been imperfectly preserved in the verses of
      claudian, since the poet, who celebrates his virtue, has omitted
      the mention of his name. his death was followed by the flight and
      dismay of the squadrons which he commanded; and the defeat of the
      wing of cavalry might have decided the victory of alaric, if
      stilicho had not immediately led the roman and barbarian infantry
      to the attack. the skill of the general, and the bravery of the
      soldiers, surmounted every obstacle. in the evening of the bloody
      day, the goths retreated from the field of battle; the
      intrenchments of their camp were forced, and the scene of rapine
      and slaughter made some atonement for the calamities which they
      had inflicted on the subjects of the empire. 45 the magnificent
      spoils of corinth and argos enriched the veterans of the west;
      the captive wife of alaric, who had impatiently claimed his
      promise of roman jewels and patrician handmaids, 46 was reduced
      to implore the mercy of the insulting foe; and many thousand
      prisoners, released from the gothic chains, dispersed through the
      provinces of italy the praises of their heroic deliverer. the
      triumph of stilicho 47 was compared by the poet, and perhaps by
      the public, to that of marius; who, in the same part of italy,
      had encountered and destroyed another army of northern
      barbarians. the huge bones, and the empty helmets, of the cimbri
      and of the goths, would easily be confounded by succeeding
      generations; and posterity might erect a common trophy to the
      memory of the two most illustrious generals, who had vanquished,
      on the same memorable ground, the two most formidable enemies of
      rome. 48

      geography of a poet. verselle and pollentia are sixty miles from
      each other; and the latitude is still greater, if the cimbri were
      defeated in the wide and barren plain of verona, (maffei, verona
      illustrata, p. i. p. 54-62.)]

      the eloquence of claudian 49 has celebrated, with lavish
      applause, the victory of pollentia, one of the most glorious days
      in the life of his patron; but his reluctant and partial muse
      bestows more genuine praise on the character of the gothic king.
      his name is, indeed, branded with the reproachful epithets of
      pirate and robber, to which the conquerors of every age are so
      justly entitled; but the poet of stilicho is compelled to
      acknowledge that alaric possessed the invincible temper of mind,
      which rises superior to every misfortune, and derives new
      resources from adversity. after the total defeat of his infantry,
      he escaped, or rather withdrew, from the field of battle, with
      the greatest part of his cavalry entire and unbroken. without
      wasting a moment to lament the irreparable loss of so many brave
      companions, he left his victorious enemy to bind in chains the
      captive images of a gothic king; 50 and boldly resolved to break
      through the unguarded passes of the apennine, to spread
      desolation over the fruitful face of tuscany, and to conquer or
      die before the gates of rome. the capital was saved by the active
      and incessant diligence of stilicho; but he respected the despair
      of his enemy; and, instead of committing the fate of the republic
      to the chance of another battle, he proposed to purchase the
      absence of the barbarians. the spirit of alaric would have
      rejected such terms, the permission of a retreat, and the offer
      of a pension, with contempt and indignation; but he exercised a
      limited and precarious authority over the independent chieftains
      who had raised him, for their service, above the rank of his
      equals; they were still less disposed to follow an unsuccessful
      general, and many of them were tempted to consult their interest
      by a private negotiation with the minister of honorius. the king
      submitted to the voice of his people, ratified the treaty with
      the empire of the west, and repassed the po with the remains of
      the flourishing army which he had led into italy. a considerable
      part of the roman forces still continued to attend his motions;
      and stilicho, who maintained a secret correspondence with some of
      the barbarian chiefs, was punctually apprised of the designs that
      were formed in the camp and council of alaric. the king of the
      goths, ambitious to signalize his retreat by some splendid
      achievement, had resolved to occupy the important city of verona,
      which commands the principal passage of the rhaetian alps; and,
      directing his march through the territories of those german
      tribes, whose alliance would restore his exhausted strength, to
      invade, on the side of the rhine, the wealthy and unsuspecting
      provinces of gaul. ignorant of the treason which had already
      betrayed his bold and judicious enterprise, he advanced towards
      the passes of the mountains, already possessed by the imperial
      troops; where he was exposed, almost at the same instant, to a
      general attack in the front, on his flanks, and in the rear. in
      this bloody action, at a small distance from the walls of verona,
      the loss of the goths was not less heavy than that which they had
      sustained in the defeat of pollentia; and their valiant king, who
      escaped by the swiftness of his horse, must either have been
      slain or made prisoner, if the hasty rashness of the alani had
      not disappointed the measures of the roman general. alaric
      secured the remains of his army on the adjacent rocks; and
      prepared himself, with undaunted resolution, to maintain a siege
      against the superior numbers of the enemy, who invested him on
      all sides. but he could not oppose the destructive progress of
      hunger and disease; nor was it possible for him to check the
      continual desertion of his impatient and capricious barbarians.
      in this extremity he still found resources in his own courage, or
      in the moderation of his adversary; and the retreat of the gothic
      king was considered as the deliverance of italy. 51 yet the
      people, and even the clergy, incapable of forming any rational
      judgment of the business of peace and war, presumed to arraign
      the policy of stilicho, who so often vanquished, so often
      surrounded, and so often dismissed the implacable enemy of the
      republic. the first momen of the public safety is devoted to
      gratitude and joy; but the second is diligently occupied by envy
      and calumny. 52

      the citizens of rome had been astonished by the approach of
      alaric; and the diligence with which they labored to restore the
      walls of the capital, confessed their own fears, and the decline
      of the empire. after the retreat of the barbarians, honorius was
      directed to accept the dutiful invitation of the senate, and to
      celebrate, in the imperial city, the auspicious era of the
      gothic victory, and of his sixth consulship. 53 the suburbs and
      the streets, from the milvian bridge to the palatine mount, were
      filled by the roman people, who, in the space of a hundred years,
      had only thrice been honored with the presence of their
      sovereigns. while their eyes were fixed on the chariot where
      stilicho was deservedly seated by the side of his royal pupil,
      they applauded the pomp of a triumph, which was not stained, like
      that of constantine, or of theodosius, with civil blood. the
      procession passed under a lofty arch, which had been purposely
      erected: but in less than seven years, the gothic conquerors of
      rome might read, if they were able to read, the superb
      inscription of that monument, which attested the total defeat and
      destruction of their nation. 54 the emperor resided several
      months in the capital, and every part of his behavior was
      regulated with care to conciliate the affection of the clergy,
      the senate, and the people of rome. the clergy was edified by his
      frequent visits and liberal gifts to the shrines of the apostles.
      the senate, who, in the triumphal procession, had been excused
      from the humiliating ceremony of preceding on foot the imperial
      chariot, was treated with the decent reverence which stilicho
      always affected for that assembly. the people was repeatedly
      gratified by the attention and courtesy of honorius in the public
      games, which were celebrated on that occasion with a magnificence
      not unworthy of the spectator. as soon as the appointed number of
      chariot-races was concluded, the decoration of the circus was
      suddenly changed; the hunting of wild beasts afforded a various
      and splendid entertainment; and the chase was succeeded by a
      military dance, which seems, in the lively description of
      claudian, to present the image of a modern tournament.

      in these games of honorius, the inhuman combats of gladiators 55
      polluted, for the last time, the amphitheater of rome. the first
      christian emperor may claim the honor of the first edict which
      condemned the art and amusement of shedding human blood; 56 but
      this benevolent law expressed the wishes of the prince, without
      reforming an inveterate abuse, which degraded a civilized nation
      below the condition of savage cannibals. several hundred, perhaps
      several thousand, victims were annually slaughtered in the great
      cities of the empire; and the month of december, more peculiarly
      devoted to the combats of gladiators, still exhibited to the eyes
      of the roman people a grateful spectacle of blood and cruelty.
      amidst the general joy of the victory of pollentia, a christian
      poet exhorted the emperor to extirpate, by his authority, the
      horrid custom which had so long resisted the voice of humanity
      and religion. 57 the pathetic representations of prudentius were
      less effectual than the generous boldness of telemachus, an
      asiatic monk, whose death was more useful to mankind than his

      pleasures; and the rash monk, who had descended into the arena to
      separate the gladiators, was overwhelmed under a shower of
      stones. but the madness of the people soon subsided; they
      respected the memory of telemachus, who had deserved the honors
      of martyrdom; and they submitted, without a murmur, to the laws
      of honorius, which abolished forever the human sacrifices of the
      amphitheater. 5811 the citizens, who adhered to the manners of
      their ancestors, might perhaps insinuate that the last remains of
      a martial spirit were preserved in this school of fortitude,
      which accustomed the romans to the sight of blood, and to the
      contempt of death; a vain and cruel prejudice, so nobly confuted
      by the valor of ancient greece, and of modern europe! 59

      the recent danger, to which the person of the emperor had been
      exposed in the defenceless palace of milan, urged him to seek a
      retreat in some inaccessible fortress of italy, where he might
      securely remain, while the open country was covered by a deluge
      of barbarians. on the coast of the adriatic, about ten or twelve
      miles from the most southern of the seven mouths of the po, the
      thessalians had founded the ancient colony of ravenna, 60 which
      they afterwards resigned to the natives of umbria. augustus, who
      had observed the opportunity of the place, prepared, at the
      distance of three miles from the old town, a capacious harbor,
      for the reception of two hundred and fifty ships of war. this
      naval establishment, which included the arsenals and magazines,
      the barracks of the troops, and the houses of the artificers,
      derived its origin and name from the permanent station of the
      roman fleet; the intermediate space was soon filled with
      buildings and inhabitants, and the three extensive and populous
      quarters of ravenna gradually contributed to form one of the most
      important cities of italy. the principal canal of augustus poured
      a copious stream of the waters of the po through the midst of the
      city, to the entrance of the harbor; the same waters were
      introduced into the profound ditches that encompassed the walls;
      they were distributed by a thousand subordinate canals, into
      every part of the city, which they divided into a variety of
      small islands; the communication was maintained only by the use
      of boats and bridges; and the houses of ravenna, whose appearance
      may be compared to that of venice, were raised on the foundation
      of wooden piles. the adjacent country, to the distance of many
      miles, was a deep and impassable morass; and the artificial
      causeway, which connected ravenna with the continent, might be
      easily guarded or destroyed, on the approach of a hostile army
      these morasses were interspersed, however, with vineyards: and
      though the soil was exhausted by four or five crops, the town
      enjoyed a more plentiful supply of wine than of fresh water. 61
      the air, instead of receiving the sickly, and almost
      pestilential, exhalations of low and marshy grounds, was
      distinguished, like the neighborhood of alexandria, as uncommonly
      pure and salubrious; and this singular advantage was ascribed to
      the regular tides of the adriatic, which swept the canals,
      interrupted the unwholesome stagnation of the waters, and
      floated, every day, the vessels of the adjacent country into the
      heart of ravenna. the gradual retreat of the sea has left the
      modern city at the distance of four miles from the adriatic; and
      as early as the fifth or sixth century of the christian era, the
      port of augustus was converted into pleasant orchards; and a
      lonely grove of pines covered the ground where the roman fleet
      once rode at anchor. 62 even this alteration contributed to
      increase the natural strength of the place, and the shallowness
      of the water was a sufficient barrier against the large ships of
      the enemy. this advantageous situation was fortified by art and
      labor; and in the twentieth year of his age, the emperor of the
      west, anxious only for his personal safety, retired to the
      perpetual confinement of the walls and morasses of ravenna. the
      example of honorius was imitated by his feeble successors, the
      gothic kings, and afterwards the exarchs, who occupied the throne
      and palace of the emperors; and till the middle of the eight
      century, ravenna was considered as the seat of government, and
      the capital of italy. 63

      the fears of honorius were not without foundation, nor were his
      precautions without effect. while italy rejoiced in her
      deliverance from the goths, a furious tempest was excited among
      the nations of germany, who yielded to the irresistible impulse
      that appears to have been gradually communicated from the eastern
      extremity of the continent of asia. the chinese annals, as they
      have been interpreted by the learned industry of the present age,
      may be usefully applied to reveal the secret and remote causes of
      the fall of the roman empire. the extensive territory to the
      north of the great wall was possessed, after the flight of the
      huns, by the victorious sienpi, who were sometimes broken into
      independent tribes, and sometimes reunited under a supreme chief;
      till at length, styling themselves topa, or masters of the earth,
      they acquired a more solid consistence, and a more formidable
      power. the topa soon compelled the pastoral nations of the
      eastern desert to acknowledge the superiority of their arms; they
      invaded china in a period of weakness and intestine discord; and
      these fortunate tartars, adopting the laws and manners of the
      vanquished people, founded an imperial dynasty, which reigned
      near one hundred and sixty years over the northern provinces of
      the monarchy. some generations before they ascended the throne of
      china, one of the topa princes had enlisted in his cavalry a
      slave of the name of moko, renowned for his valor, but who was
      tempted, by the fear of punishment, to desert his standard, and
      to range the desert at the head of a hundred followers. this gang
      of robbers and outlaws swelled into a camp, a tribe, a numerous
      people, distinguished by the appellation of geougen; and their
      hereditary chieftains, the posterity of moko the slave, assumed
      their rank among the scythian monarchs. the youth of toulun, the
      greatest of his descendants, was exercised by those misfortunes
      which are the school of heroes. he bravely struggled with
      adversity, broke the imperious yoke of the topa, and became the
      legislator of his nation, and the conqueror of tartary. his
      troops were distributed into regular bands of a hundred and of a
      thousand men; cowards were stoned to death; the most splendid
      honors were proposed as the reward of valor; and toulun, who had
      knowledge enough to despise the learning of china, adopted only
      such arts and institutions as were favorable to the military
      spirit of his government. his tents, which he removed in the
      winter season to a more southern latitude, were pitched, during
      the summer, on the fruitful banks of the selinga. his conquests
      stretched from corea far beyond the river irtish. he vanquished,
      in the country to the north of the caspian sea, the nation of the
      huns; and the new title of khan, or cagan, expressed the fame and
      power which he derived from this memorable victory. 64

      the chain of events is interrupted, or rather is concealed, as it
      passes from the volga to the vistula, through the dark interval
      which separates the extreme limits of the chinese, and of the
      roman, geography. yet the temper of the barbarians, and the
      experience of successive emigrations, sufficiently declare, that
      the huns, who were oppressed by the arms of the geougen, soon
      withdrew from the presence of an insulting victor. the countries
      towards the euxine were already occupied by their kindred tribes;
      and their hasty flight, which they soon converted into a bold
      attack, would more naturally be directed towards the rich and
      level plains, through which the vistula gently flows into the
      baltic sea. the north must again have been alarmed, and agitated,
      by the invasion of the huns; 6411 and the nations who retreated
      before them must have pressed with incumbent weight on the
      confines of germany. 65 the inhabitants of those regions, which
      the ancients have assigned to the suevi, the vandals, and the
      burgundians, might embrace the resolution of abandoning to the
      fugitives of sarmatia their woods and morasses; or at least of
      discharging their superfluous numbers on the provinces of the
      roman empire. 66 about four years after the victorious toulun had
      assumed the title of khan of the geougen, another barbarian, the
      haughty rhodogast, or radagaisus, 67 marched from the northern
      extremities of germany almost to the gates of rome, and left the
      remains of his army to achieve the destruction of the west. the
      vandals, the suevi, and the burgundians, formed the strength of
      this mighty host; but the alani, who had found a hospitable
      reception in their new seats, added their active cavalry to the
      heavy infantry of the germans; and the gothic adventurers crowded
      so eagerly to the standard of radagaisus, that by some
      historians, he has been styled the king of the goths. twelve
      thousand warriors, distinguished above the vulgar by their noble
      birth, or their valiant deeds, glittered in the van; 68 and the
      whole multitude, which was not less than two hundred thousand
      fighting men, might be increased, by the accession of women, of
      children, and of slaves, to the amount of four hundred thousand
      persons. this formidable emigration issued from the same coast of
      the baltic, which had poured forth the myriads of the cimbri and
      teutones, to assault rome and italy in the vigor of the republic.
      after the departure of those barbarians, their native country,
      which was marked by the vestiges of their greatness, long
      ramparts, and gigantic moles, 69 remained, during some ages, a
      vast and dreary solitude; till the human species was renewed by
      the powers of generation, and the vacancy was filled by the
      influx of new inhabitants. the nations who now usurp an extent of
      land which they are unable to cultivate, would soon be assisted
      by the industrious poverty of their neighbors, if the government
      of europe did not protect the claims of dominion and property.

      chapter xxx: revolt of the goths.part iv.

      the correspondence of nations was, in that age, so imperfect and
      precarious, that the revolutions of the north might escape the
      knowledge of the court of ravenna; till the dark cloud, which was
      collected along the coast of the baltic, burst in thunder upon
      the banks of the upper danube. the emperor of the west, if his
      ministers disturbed his amusements by the news of the impending
      danger, was satisfied with being the occasion, and the spectator,
      of the war. 70 the safety of rome was intrusted to the counsels,
      and the sword, of stilicho; but such was the feeble and exhausted
      state of the empire, that it was impossible to restore the
      fortifications of the danube, or to prevent, by a vigorous
      effort, the invasion of the germans. 71 the hopes of the vigilant
      minister of honorius were confined to the defence of italy. he
      once more abandoned the provinces, recalled the troops, pressed
      the new levies, which were rigorously exacted, and
      pusillanimously eluded; employed the most efficacious means to
      arrest, or allure, the deserters; and offered the gift of
      freedom, and of two pieces of gold, to all the slaves who would
      enlist. 72 by these efforts he painfully collected, from the
      subjects of a great empire, an army of thirty or forty thousand
      men, which, in the days of scipio or camillus, would have been
      instantly furnished by the free citizens of the territory of
      rome. 73 the thirty legions of stilicho were reenforced by a
      large body of barbarian auxiliaries; the faithful alani were
      personally attached to his service; and the troops of huns and of
      goths, who marched under the banners of their native princes,
      huldin and sarus, were animated by interest and resentment to
      oppose the ambition of radagaisus. the king of the confederate
      germans passed, without resistance, the alps, the po, and the
      apennine; leaving on one hand the inaccessible palace of
      honorius, securely buried among the marshes of ravenna; and, on
      the other, the camp of stilicho, who had fixed his head-quarters
      at ticinum, or pavia, but who seems to have avoided a decisive
      battle, till he had assembled his distant forces. many cities of
      italy were pillaged, or destroyed; and the siege of florence, 74
      by radagaisus, is one of the earliest events in the history of
      that celebrated republic; whose firmness checked and delayed the
      unskillful fury of the barbarians. the senate and people trembled
      at their approach within a hundred and eighty miles of rome; and
      anxiously compared the danger which they had escaped, with the
      new perils to which they were exposed. alaric was a christian and
      a soldier, the leader of a disciplined army; who understood the
      laws of war, who respected the sanctity of treaties, and who had
      familiarly conversed with the subjects of the empire in the same
      camps, and the same churches. the savage radagaisus was a
      stranger to the manners, the religion, and even the language, of
      the civilized nations of the south. the fierceness of his temper
      was exasperated by cruel superstition; and it was universally
      believed, that he had bound himself, by a solemn vow, to reduce
      the city into a heap of stones and ashes, and to sacrifice the
      most illustrious of the roman senators on the altars of those
      gods who were appeased by human blood. the public danger, which
      should have reconciled all domestic animosities, displayed the
      incurable madness of religious faction. the oppressed votaries of
      jupiter and mercury respected, in the implacable enemy of rome,
      the character of a devout pagan; loudly declared, that they were
      more apprehensive of the sacrifices, than of the arms, of
      radagaisus; and secretly rejoiced in the calamities of their

      camp was the scene of plenty and idleness, enjoyed the distress
      of the barbarians, slowly expiring on the sharp and barren ridge
      of the hills of faesulae, which rise above the city of florence.
      their extravagant assertion that not a single soldier of the
      christian army was killed, or even wounded, may be dismissed with
      silent contempt; but the rest of the narrative of augustin and
      orosius is consistent with the state of the war, and the
      character of stilicho. conscious that he commanded the last army
      of the republic, his prudence would not expose it, in the open
      field, to the headstrong fury of the germans. the method of
      surrounding the enemy with strong lines of circumvallation, which
      he had twice employed against the gothic king, was repeated on a
      larger scale, and with more considerable effect. the examples of
      caesar must have been familiar to the most illiterate of the
      roman warriors; and the fortifications of dyrrachium, which
      connected twenty-four castles, by a perpetual ditch and rampart
      of fifteen miles, afforded the model of an intrenchment which
      might confine, and starve, the most numerous host of barbarians.
      78 the roman troops had less degenerated from the industry, than
      from the valor, of their ancestors; and if their servile and
      laborious work offended the pride of the soldiers, tuscany could
      supply many thousand peasants, who would labor, though, perhaps,
      they would not fight, for the salvation of their native country.
      the imprisoned multitude of horses and men 79 was gradually
      destroyed, by famine rather than by the sword; but the romans
      were exposed, during the progress of such an extensive work, to
      the frequent attacks of an impatient enemy. the despair of the
      hungry barbarians would precipitate them against the
      fortifications of stilicho; the general might sometimes indulge
      the ardor of his brave auxiliaries, who eagerly pressed to
      assault the camp of the germans; and these various incidents
      might produce the sharp and bloody conflicts which dignify the
      narrative of zosimus, and the chronicles of prosper and
      marcellinus. 80 a seasonable supply of men and provisions had
      been introduced into the walls of florence, and the famished host
      of radagaisus was in its turn besieged. the proud monarch of so
      many warlike nations, after the loss of his bravest warriors, was
      reduced to confide either in the faith of a capitulation, or in
      the clemency of stilicho. 81 but the death of the royal captive,
      who was ignominiously beheaded, disgraced the triumph of rome and
      of christianity; and the short delay of his execution was
      sufficient to brand the conqueror with the guilt of cool and
      deliberate cruelty. 82 the famished germans, who escaped the fury
      of the auxiliaries, were sold as slaves, at the contemptible
      price of as many single pieces of gold; but the difference of
      food and climate swept away great numbers of those unhappy
      strangers; and it was observed, that the inhuman purchasers,
      instead of reaping the fruits of their labor were soon obliged to
      provide the expense of their interment. stilicho informed the
      emperor and the senate of his success; and deserved, a second
      time, the glorious title of deliverer of italy. 83

      encouraged a vain persuasion, that the whole army, or rather
      nation, of germans, who migrated from the shores of the baltic,
      miserably perished under the walls of florence. such indeed was
      the fate of radagaisus himself, of his brave and faithful
      companions, and of more than one third of the various multitude
      of sueves and vandals, of alani and burgundians, who adhered to
      the standard of their general. 84 the union of such an army might
      excite our surprise, but the causes of separation are obvious and

      jealousy of command, the impatience of subordination, and the

      attempted to revenge the death of their general; but their
      irregular fury was soon diverted by the prudence and firmness of
      stilicho, who opposed their march, and facilitated their retreat;
      who considered the safety of rome and italy as the great object
      of his care, and who sacrificed, with too much indifference, the

      yet if they expected to derive any assistance from the tribes of
      germany, who inhabited the banks of the rhine, their hopes were
      disappointed. the alemanni preserved a state of inactive
      neutrality; and the franks distinguished their zeal and courage
      in the defence of the of the empire. in the rapid progress down
      the rhine, which was the first act of the administration of
      stilicho, he had applied himself, with peculiar attention, to
      secure the alliance of the warlike franks, and to remove the
      irreconcilable enemies of peace and of the republic. marcomir,
      one of their kings, was publicly convicted, before the tribunal
      of the roman magistrate, of violating the faith of treaties. he
      was sentenced to a mild, but distant exile, in the province of
      tuscany; and this degradation of the regal dignity was so far
      from exciting the resentment of his subjects, that they punished
      with death the turbulent sunno, who attempted to revenge his
      brother; and maintained a dutiful allegiance to the princes, who
      were established on the throne by the choice of stilicho. 87 when
      the limits of gaul and germany were shaken by the northern
      emigration, the franks bravely encountered the single force of
      the vandals; who, regardless of the lessons of adversity, had
      again separated their troops from the standard of their barbarian
      allies. they paid the penalty of their rashness; and twenty
      thousand vandals, with their king godigisclus, were slain in the
      field of battle. the whole people must have been extirpated, if
      the squadrons of the alani, advancing to their relief, had not
      trampled down the infantry of the franks; who, after an honorable
      resistance, were compelled to relinquish the unequal contest. the
      victorious confederates pursued their march, and on the last day
      of the year, in a season when the waters of the rhine were most
      probably frozen, they entered, without opposition, the
      defenceless provinces of gaul. this memorable passage of the
      suevi, the vandals, the alani, and the burgundians, who never
      afterwards retreated, may be considered as the fall of the roman
      empire in the countries beyond the alps; and the barriers, which
      had so long separated the savage and the civilized nations of the
      earth, were from that fatal moment levelled with the ground. 88

      while the peace of germany was secured by the attachment of the
      franks, and the neutrality of the alemanni, the subjects of rome,
      unconscious of their approaching calamities, enjoyed the state of
      quiet and prosperity, which had seldom blessed the frontiers of
      gaul. their flocks and herds were permitted to graze in the
      pastures of the barbarians; their huntsmen penetrated, without
      fear or danger, into the darkest recesses of the hercynian wood.
      89 the banks of the rhine were crowned, like those of the tyber,
      with elegant houses, and well-cultivated farms; and if a poet
      descended the river, he might express his doubt, on which side
      was situated the territory of the romans. 90 this scene of peace
      and plenty was suddenly changed into a desert; and the prospect
      of the smoking ruins could alone distinguish the solitude of
      nature from the desolation of man. the flourishing city of mentz
      was surprised and destroyed; and many thousand christians were
      inhumanly massacred in the church. worms perished after a long
      and obstinate siege; strasburgh, spires, rheims, tournay, arras,
      amiens, experienced the cruel oppression of the german yoke; and
      the consuming flames of war spread from the banks of the rhine
      over the greatest part of the seventeen provinces of gaul. that
      rich and extensive country, as far as the ocean, the alps, and
      the pyrenees, was delivered to the barbarians, who drove before
      them, in a promiscuous crowd, the bishop, the senator, and the
      virgin, laden with the spoils of their houses and altars. 91 the
      ecclesiastics, to whom we are indebted for this vague description
      of the public calamities, embraced the opportunity of exhorting
      the christians to repent of the sins which had provoked the
      divine justice, and to renounce the perishable goods of a
      wretched and deceitful world. but as the pelagian controversy, 92
      which attempts to sound the abyss of grace and predestination,
      soon became the serious employment of the latin clergy, the
      providence which had decreed, or foreseen, or permitted, such a
      train of moral and natural evils, was rashly weighed in the
      imperfect and fallacious balance of reason. the crimes, and the
      misfortunes, of the suffering people, were presumptuously
      compared with those of their ancestors; and they arraigned the
      divine justice, which did not exempt from the common destruction
      the feeble, the guiltless, the infant portion of the human
      species. these idle disputants overlooked the invariable laws of
      nature, which have connected peace with innocence, plenty with
      industry, and safety with valor. the timid and selfish policy of
      the court of ravenna might recall the palatine legions for the
      protection of italy; the remains of the stationary troops might
      be unequal to the arduous task; and the barbarian auxiliaries
      might prefer the unbounded license of spoil to the benefits of a
      moderate and regular stipend. but the provinces of gaul were
      filled with a numerous race of hardy and robust youth, who, in
      the defence of their houses, their families, and their altars, if
      they had dared to die, would have deserved to vanquish. the
      knowledge of their native country would have enabled them to
      oppose continual and insuperable obstacles to the progress of an
      invader; and the deficiency of the barbarians, in arms, as well
      as in discipline, removed the only pretence which excuses the
      submission of a populous country to the inferior numbers of a
      veteran army. when france was invaded by charles v., he inquired
      of a prisoner, how many days paris might be distant from the
      frontier; perhaps twelve, but they will be days of battle: 93
      such was the gallant answer which checked the arrogance of that
      ambitious prince. the subjects of honorius, and those of francis
      i., were animated by a very different spirit; and in less than
      two years, the divided troops of the savages of the baltic, whose
      numbers, were they fairly stated, would appear contemptible,
      advanced, without a combat, to the foot of the pyrenean
      mountains.

      in the early part of the reign of honorius, the vigilance of
      stilicho had successfully guarded the remote island of britain
      from her incessant enemies of the ocean, the mountains, and the
      irish coast. 94 but those restless barbarians could not neglect
      the fair opportunity of the gothic war, when the walls and
      stations of the province were stripped of the roman troops. if
      any of the legionaries were permitted to return from the italian
      expedition, their faithful report of the court and character of
      honorius must have tended to dissolve the bonds of allegiance,
      and to exasperate the seditious temper of the british army. the
      spirit of revolt, which had formerly disturbed the age of
      gallienus, was revived by the capricious violence of the
      soldiers; and the unfortunate, perhaps the ambitious, candidates,
      who were the objects of their choice, were the instruments, and
      at length the victims, of their passion. 95 marcus was the first
      whom they placed on the throne, as the lawful emperor of britain
      and of the west. they violated, by the hasty murder of marcus,
      the oath of fidelity which they had imposed on themselves; and
      their disapprobation of his manners may seem to inscribe an
      honorable epitaph on his tomb. gratian was the next whom they
      adorned with the diadem and the purple; and, at the end of four
      months, gratian experienced the fate of his predecessor. the
      memory of the great constantine, whom the british legions had
      given to the church and to the empire, suggested the singular
      motive of their third choice. they discovered in the ranks a
      private soldier of the name of constantine, and their impetuous
      levity had already seated him on the throne, before they
      perceived his incapacity to sustain the weight of that glorious
      appellation. 96 yet the authority of constantine was less
      precarious, and his government was more successful, than the
      transient reigns of marcus and of gratian. the danger of leaving
      his inactive troops in those camps, which had been twice polluted
      with blood and sedition, urged him to attempt the reduction of
      the western provinces. he landed at boulogne with an
      inconsiderable force; and after he had reposed himself some days,
      he summoned the cities of gaul, which had escaped the yoke of the
      barbarians, to acknowledge their lawful sovereign. they obeyed
      the summons without reluctance. the neglect of the court of
      ravenna had absolved a deserted people from the duty of
      allegiance; their actual distress encouraged them to accept any
      circumstances of change, without apprehension, and, perhaps, with
      some degree of hope; and they might flatter themselves, that the
      troops, the authority, and even the name of a roman emperor, who
      fixed his residence in gaul, would protect the unhappy country
      from the rage of the barbarians. the first successes of
      constantine against the detached parties of the germans, were
      magnified by the voice of adulation into splendid and decisive
      victories; which the reunion and insolence of the enemy soon
      reduced to their just value. his negotiations procured a short
      and precarious truce; and if some tribes of the barbarians were
      engaged, by the liberality of his gifts and promises, to
      undertake the defence of the rhine, these expensive and uncertain
      treaties, instead of restoring the pristine vigor of the gallic
      frontier, served only to disgrace the majesty of the prince, and
      to exhaust what yet remained of the treasures of the republic.
      elated, however, with this imaginary triumph, the vain deliverer
      of gaul advanced into the provinces of the south, to encounter a
      more pressing and personal danger. sarus the goth was ordered to
      lay the head of the rebel at the feet of the emperor honorius;
      and the forces of britain and italy were unworthily consumed in
      this domestic quarrel. after the loss of his two bravest
      generals, justinian and nevigastes, the former of whom was slain
      in the field of battle, the latter in a peaceful but treacherous
      interview, constantine fortified himself within the walls of
      vienna. the place was ineffectually attacked seven days; and the
      imperial army supported, in a precipitate retreat, the ignominy
      of purchasing a secure passage from the freebooters and outlaws
      of the alps. 97 those mountains now separated the dominions of
      two rival monarchs; and the fortifications of the double frontier
      were guarded by the troops of the empire, whose arms would have
      been more usefully employed to maintain the roman limits against
      the barbarians of germany and scythia.

      chapter xxx: revolt of the goths.part v.

      on the side of the pyrenees, the ambition of constantine might be
      justified by the proximity of danger; but his throne was soon
      established by the conquest, or rather submission, of spain;
      which yielded to the influence of regular and habitual
      subordination, and received the laws and magistrates of the
      gallic prfecture. the only opposition which was made to the
      authority of constantine proceeded not so much from the powers of
      government, or the spirit of the people, as from the private zeal
      and interest of the family of theodosius. four brothers 98 had
      obtained, by the favor of their kinsman, the deceased emperor, an
      honorable rank and ample possessions in their native country; and
      the grateful youths resolved to risk those advantages in the
      service of his son. after an unsuccessful effort to maintain
      their ground at the head of the stationary troops of lusitania,
      they retired to their estates; where they armed and levied, at
      their own expense, a considerable body of slaves and dependants,
      and boldly marched to occupy the strong posts of the pyrenean
      mountains. this domestic insurrection alarmed and perplexed the
      sovereign of gaul and britain; and he was compelled to negotiate
      with some troops of barbarian auxiliaries, for the service of the
      spanish war. they were distinguished by the title of honorians;
      99 a name which might have reminded them of their fidelity to
      their lawful sovereign; and if it should candidly be allowed that
      the scots were influenced by any partial affection for a british
      prince, the moors and the marcomanni could be tempted only by the
      profuse liberality of the usurper, who distributed among the
      barbarians the military, and even the civil, honors of spain. the
      nine bands of honorians, which may be easily traced on the
      establishment of the western empire, could not exceed the number
      of five thousand men: yet this inconsiderable force was
      sufficient to terminate a war, which had threatened the power and
      safety of constantine. the rustic army of the theodosian family
      was surrounded and destroyed in the pyrenees: two of the brothers
      had the good fortune to escape by sea to italy, or the east; the
      other two, after an interval of suspense, were executed at arles;
      and if honorius could remain insensible of the public disgrace,
      he might perhaps be affected by the personal misfortunes of his
      generous kinsmen. such were the feeble arms which decided the
      possession of the western provinces of europe, from the wall of
      antoninus to the columns of hercules. the events of peace and war
      have undoubtedly been diminished by the narrow and imperfect view
      of the historians of the times, who were equally ignorant of the
      causes, and of the effects, of the most important revolutions.
      but the total decay of the national strength had annihilated even
      the last resource of a despotic government; and the revenue of
      exhausted provinces could no longer purchase the military service
      of a discontented and pusillanimous people.

      the poet, whose flattery has ascribed to the roman eagle the
      victories of pollentia and verona, pursues the hasty retreat of
      alaric, from the confines of italy, with a horrid train of
      imaginary spectres, such as might hover over an army of
      barbarians, which was almost exterminated by war, famine, and
      disease. 100 in the course of this unfortunate expedition, the
      king of the goths must indeed have sustained a considerable loss;
      and his harassed forces required an interval of repose, to
      recruit their numbers and revive their confidence. adversity had
      exercised and displayed the genius of alaric; and the fame of his
      valor invited to the gothic standard the bravest of the barbarian
      warriors; who, from the euxine to the rhine, were agitated by the
      desire of rapine and conquest. he had deserved the esteem, and he
      soon accepted the friendship, of stilicho himself. renouncing the
      service of the emperor of the east, alaric concluded, with the
      court of ravenna, a treaty of peace and alliance, by which he was
      declared master-general of the roman armies throughout the
      prfecture of illyricum; as it was claimed, according to the
      true and ancient limits, by the minister of honorius. 101 the
      execution of the ambitious design, which was either stipulated,
      or implied, in the articles of the treaty, appears to have been
      suspended by the formidable irruption of radagaisus; and the
      neutrality of the gothic king may perhaps be compared to the
      indifference of caesar, who, in the conspiracy of catiline,
      refused either to assist, or to oppose, the enemy of the
      republic. after the defeat of the vandals, stilicho resumed his
      pretensions to the provinces of the east; appointed civil
      magistrates for the administration of justice, and of the
      finances; and declared his impatience to lead to the gates of
      constantinople the united armies of the romans and of the goths.
      the prudence, however, of stilicho, his aversion to civil war,
      and his perfect knowledge of the weakness of the state, may
      countenance the suspicion, that domestic peace, rather than
      foreign conquest, was the object of his policy; and that his
      principal care was to employ the forces of alaric at a distance
      from italy. this design could not long escape the penetration of
      the gothic king, who continued to hold a doubtful, and perhaps a
      treacherous, correspondence with the rival courts; who
      protracted, like a dissatisfied mercenary, his languid operations
      in thessaly and epirus, and who soon returned to claim the
      extravagant reward of his ineffectual services. from his camp
      near aemona, 102 on the confines of italy, he transmitted to the
      emperor of the west a long account of promises, of expenses, and
      of demands; called for immediate satisfaction, and clearly
      intimated the consequences of a refusal. yet if his conduct was
      hostile, his language was decent and dutiful. he humbly professed
      himself the friend of stilicho, and the soldier of honorius;
      offered his person and his troops to march, without delay,
      against the usurper of gaul; and solicited, as a permanent
      retreat for the gothic nation, the possession of some vacant
      province of the western empire.

      the political and secret transactions of two statesmen, who
      labored to deceive each other and the world, must forever have
      been concealed in the impenetrable darkness of the cabinet, if
      the debates of a popular assembly had not thrown some rays of
      light on the correspondence of alaric and stilicho. the necessity
      of finding some artificial support for a government, which, from
      a principle, not of moderation, but of weakness, was reduced to
      negotiate with its own subjects, had insensibly revived the
      authority of the roman senate; and the minister of honorius
      respectfully consulted the legislative council of the republic.
      stilicho assembled the senate in the palace of the caesars;
      represented, in a studied oration, the actual state of affairs;
      proposed the demands of the gothic king, and submitted to their
      consideration the choice of peace or war. the senators, as if
      they had been suddenly awakened from a dream of four hundred
      years, appeared, on this important occasion, to be inspired by
      the courage, rather than by the wisdom, of their predecessors.
      they loudly declared, in regular speeches, or in tumultuary
      acclamations, that it was unworthy of the majesty of rome to
      purchase a precarious and disgraceful truce from a barbarian
      king; and that, in the judgment of a magnanimous people, the
      chance of ruin was always preferable to the certainty of
      dishonor. the minister, whose pacific intentions were seconded
      only by the voice of a few servile and venal followers, attempted
      to allay the general ferment, by an apology for his own conduct,
      and even for the demands of the gothic prince. the payment of a
      subsidy, which had excited the indignation of the romans, ought
      not (such was the language of stilicho) to be considered in the
      odious light, either of a tribute, or of a ransom, extorted by
      the menaces of a barbarian enemy. alaric had faithfully asserted
      the just pretensions of the republic to the provinces which were
      usurped by the greeks of constantinople: he modestly required the
      fair and stipulated recompense of his services; and if he had
      desisted from the prosecution of his enterprise, he had obeyed,
      in his retreat, the peremptory, though private, letters of the
      emperor himself. these contradictory orders (he would not
      dissemble the errors of his own family) had been procured by the
      intercession of serena. the tender piety of his wife had been too
      deeply affected by the discord of the royal brothers, the sons of
      her adopted father; and the sentiments of nature had too easily
      prevailed over the stern dictates of the public welfare. these
      ostensible reasons, which faintly disguise the obscure intrigues
      of the palace of ravenna, were supported by the authority of
      stilicho; and obtained, after a warm debate, the reluctant
      approbation of the senate. the tumult of virtue and freedom
      subsided; and the sum of four thousand pounds of gold was
      granted, under the name of a subsidy, to secure the peace of
      italy, and to conciliate the friendship of the king of the goths.
      lampadius alone, one of the most illustrious members of the
      assembly, still persisted in his dissent; exclaimed, with a loud
      voice, this is not a treaty of peace, but of servitude; 103 and
      escaped the danger of such bold opposition by immediately
      retiring to the sanctuary of a christian church. [see palace of
      the caesars]

      14.m.]

      but the reign of stilicho drew towards its end; and the proud
      minister might perceive the symptoms of his approaching disgrace.
      the generous boldness of lampadius had been applauded; and the
      senate, so patiently resigned to a long servitude, rejected with
      disdain the offer of invidious and imaginary freedom. the troops,
      who still assumed the name and prerogatives of the roman legions,
      were exasperated by the partial affection of stilicho for the
      barbarians: and the people imputed to the mischievous policy of
      the minister the public misfortunes, which were the natural
      consequence of their own degeneracy. yet stilicho might have
      continued to brave the clamors of the people, and even of the
      soldiers, if he could have maintained his dominion over the
      feeble mind of his pupil. but the respectful attachment of
      honorius was converted into fear, suspicion, and hatred. the
      crafty olympius, 104 who concealed his vices under the mask of
      christian piety, had secretly undermined the benefactor, by whose
      favor he was promoted to the honorable offices of the imperial
      palace. olympius revealed to the unsuspecting emperor, who had
      attained the twenty-fifth year of his age, that he was without
      weight, or authority, in his own government; and artfully alarmed
      his timid and indolent disposition by a lively picture of the
      designs of stilicho, who already meditated the death of his
      sovereign, with the ambitious hope of placing the diadem on the
      head of his son eucherius. the emperor was instigated, by his new
      favorite, to assume the tone of independent dignity; and the
      minister was astonished to find, that secret resolutions were
      formed in the court and council, which were repugnant to his
      interest, or to his intentions. instead of residing in the palace
      of rome, honorius declared that it was his pleasure to return to
      the secure fortress of ravenna. on the first intelligence of the
      death of his brother arcadius, he prepared to visit
      constantinople, and to regulate, with the authority of a
      guardian, the provinces of the infant theodosius. 105 the
      representation of the difficulty and expense of such a distant
      expedition, checked this strange and sudden sally of active
      diligence; but the dangerous project of showing the emperor to
      the camp of pavia, which was composed of the roman troops, the
      enemies of stilicho, and his barbarian auxiliaries, remained
      fixed and unalterable. the minister was pressed, by the advice of
      his confidant, justinian, a roman advocate, of a lively and
      penetrating genius, to oppose a journey so prejudicial to his
      reputation and safety. his strenuous but ineffectual efforts
      confirmed the triumph of olympius; and the prudent lawyer
      withdrew himself from the impending ruin of his patron.

      stilicho offered to undertake the journey to constantinople, that
      he might divert honorius from the vain attempt. the eastern
      empire would not have obeyed, and could not have been conquered.]

      in the passage of the emperor through bologna, a mutiny of the
      guards was excited and appeased by the secret policy of stilicho;
      who announced his instructions to decimate the guilty, and
      ascribed to his own intercession the merit of their pardon. after
      this tumult, honorius embraced, for the last time, the minister
      whom he now considered as a tyrant, and proceeded on his way to
      the camp of pavia; where he was received by the loyal
      acclamations of the troops who were assembled for the service of
      the gallic war. on the morning of the fourth day, he pronounced,
      as he had been taught, a military oration in the presence of the
      soldiers, whom the charitable visits, and artful discourses, of
      olympius had prepared to execute a dark and bloody conspiracy. at
      the first signal, they massacred the friends of stilicho, the
      most illustrious officers of the empire; two prtorian
      prfects, of gaul and of italy; two masters-general of the
      cavalry and infantry; the master of the offices; the quaestor,
      the treasurer, and the count of the domestics. many lives were
      lost; many houses were plundered; the furious sedition continued
      to rage till the close of the evening; and the trembling emperor,
      who was seen in the streets of pavia without his robes or diadem,
      yielded to the persuasions of his favorite; condemned the memory
      of the slain; and solemnly approved the innocence and fidelity of
      their assassins. the intelligence of the massacre of pavia filled
      the mind of stilicho with just and gloomy apprehensions; and he
      instantly summoned, in the camp of bologna, a council of the
      confederate leaders, who were attached to his service, and would
      be involved in his ruin. the impetuous voice of the assembly
      called aloud for arms, and for revenge; to march, without a
      moments delay, under the banners of a hero, whom they had so
      often followed to victory; to surprise, to oppress, to extirpate
      the guilty olympius, and his degenerate romans; and perhaps to
      fix the diadem on the head of their injured general. instead of
      executing a resolution, which might have been justified by
      success, stilicho hesitated till he was irrecoverably lost. he
      was still ignorant of the fate of the emperor; he distrusted the
      fidelity of his own party; and he viewed with horror the fatal
      consequences of arming a crowd of licentious barbarians against
      the soldiers and people of italy. the confederates, impatient of
      his timorous and doubtful delay, hastily retired, with fear and
      indignation. at the hour of midnight, sarus, a gothic warrior,
      renowned among the barbarians themselves for his strength and
      valor, suddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor, plundered the
      baggage, cut in pieces the faithful huns, who guarded his person,
      and penetrated to the tent, where the minister, pensive and
      sleepless, meditated on the dangers of his situation. stilicho
      escaped with difficulty from the sword of the goths and, after
      issuing a last and generous admonition to the cities of italy, to
      shut their gates against the barbarians, his confidence, or his
      despair, urged him to throw himself into ravenna, which was
      already in the absolute possession of his enemies. olympius, who
      had assumed the dominion of honorius, was speedily informed, that
      his rival had embraced, as a suppliant the altar of the christian
      church. the base and cruel disposition of the hypocrite was
      incapable of pity or remorse; but he piously affected to elude,
      rather than to violate, the privilege of the sanctuary. count
      heraclian, with a troop of soldiers, appeared, at the dawn of
      day, before the gates of the church of ravenna. the bishop was
      satisfied by a solemn oath, that the imperial mandate only
      directed them to secure the person of stilicho: but as soon as
      the unfortunate minister had been tempted beyond the holy
      threshold, he produced the warrant for his instant execution.
      stilicho supported, with calm resignation, the injurious names of
      traitor and parricide; repressed the unseasonable zeal of his
      followers, who were ready to attempt an ineffectual rescue; and,
      with a firmness not unworthy of the last of the roman generals,
      submitted his neck to the sword of heraclian. 106

      3, l. xii. c. 2,) afford supplemental hints.]

      the servile crowd of the palace, who had so long adored the
      fortune of stilicho, affected to insult his fall; and the most
      distant connection with the master-general of the west, which had
      so lately been a title to wealth and honors, was studiously
      denied, and rigorously punished. his family, united by a triple
      alliance with the family of theodosius, might envy the condition
      of the meanest peasant. the flight of his son eucherius was
      intercepted; and the death of that innocent youth soon followed
      the divorce of thermantia, who filled the place of her sister
      maria; and who, like maria, had remained a virgin in the imperial
      bed. 107 the friends of stilicho, who had escaped the massacre of
      pavia, were persecuted by the implacable revenge of olympius; and
      the most exquisite cruelty was employed to extort the confession
      of a treasonable and sacrilegious conspiracy. they died in
      silence: their firmness justified the choice, 108 and perhaps
      absolved the innocence of their patron: and the despotic power,
      which could take his life without a trial, and stigmatize his
      memory without a proof, has no jurisdiction over the impartial
      suffrage of posterity. 109 the services of stilicho are great and
      manifest; his crimes, as they are vaguely stated in the language
      of flattery and hatred, are obscure at least, and improbable.
      about four months after his death, an edict was published, in the
      name of honorius, to restore the free communication of the two
      empires, which had been so long interrupted by the public enemy.
      110 the minister, whose fame and fortune depended on the
      prosperity of the state, was accused of betraying italy to the
      barbarians; whom he repeatedly vanquished at pollentia, at
      verona, and before the walls of florence. his pretended design of
      placing the diadem on the head of his son eucherius, could not
      have been conducted without preparations or accomplices; and the
      ambitious father would not surely have left the future emperor,
      till the twentieth year of his age, in the humble station of
      tribune of the notaries. even the religion of stilicho was
      arraigned by the malice of his rival. the seasonable, and almost
      miraculous, deliverance was devoutly celebrated by the applause
      of the clergy; who asserted, that the restoration of idols, and
      the persecution of the church, would have been the first measure
      of the reign of eucherius. the son of stilicho, however, was
      educated in the bosom of christianity, which his father had
      uniformly professed, and zealously supported. 111 1111 serena had
      borrowed her magnificent necklace from the statue of vesta; 112
      and the pagans execrated the memory of the sacrilegious minister,
      by whose order the sibylline books, the oracles of rome, had been
      committed to the flames. 113 the pride and power of stilicho
      constituted his real guilt. an honorable reluctance to shed the
      blood of his countrymen appears to have contributed to the
      success of his unworthy rival; and it is the last humiliation of
      the character of honorius, that posterity has not condescended to
      reproach him with his base ingratitude to the guardian of his
      youth, and the support of his empire.

      among the train of dependants whose wealth and dignity attracted
      the notice of their own times, _our_ curiosity is excited by the
      celebrated name of the poet claudian, who enjoyed the favor of
      stilicho, and was overwhelmed in the ruin of his patron. the
      titular offices of tribune and notary fixed his rank in the
      imperial court: he was indebted to the powerful intercession of
      serena for his marriage with a very rich heiress of the province
      of africa; 114 and the statute of claudian, erected in the forum
      of trajan, was a monument of the taste and liberality of the
      roman senate. 115 after the praises of stilicho became offensive
      and criminal, claudian was exposed to the enmity of a powerful
      and unforgiving courtier, whom he had provoked by the insolence
      of wit. he had compared, in a lively epigram, the opposite
      characters of two prtorian prfects of italy; he contrasts the
      innocent repose of a philosopher, who sometimes resigned the
      hours of business to slumber, perhaps to study, with the
      interesting diligence of a rapacious minister, indefatigable in
      the pursuit of unjust or sacrilegious, gain. how happy,
      continues claudian, how happy might it be for the people of
      italy, if mallius could be constantly awake, and if hadrian would
      always sleep! 116 the repose of mallius was not disturbed by
      this friendly and gentle admonition; but the cruel vigilance of
      hadrian watched the opportunity of revenge, and easily obtained,
      from the enemies of stilicho, the trifling sacrifice of an
      obnoxious poet. the poet concealed himself, however, during the
      tumult of the revolution; and, consulting the dictates of
      prudence rather than of honor, he addressed, in the form of an
      epistle, a suppliant and humble recantation to the offended
      prfect. he deplores, in mournful strains, the fatal
      indiscretion into which he had been hurried by passion and folly;
      submits to the imitation of his adversary the generous examples
      of the clemency of gods, of heroes, and of lions; and expresses
      his hope that the magnanimity of hadrian will not trample on a
      defenceless and contemptible foe, already humbled by disgrace and
      poverty, and deeply wounded by the exile, the tortures, and the
      death of his dearest friends. 117 whatever might be the success
      of his prayer, or the accidents of his future life, the period of
      a few years levelled in the grave the minister and the poet: but
      the name of hadrian is almost sunk in oblivion, while claudian is
      read with pleasure in every country which has retained, or
      acquired, the knowledge of the latin language. if we fairly
      balance his merits and his defects, we shall acknowledge that
      claudian does not either satisfy, or silence, our reason. it
      would not be easy to produce a passage that deserves the epithet
      of sublime or pathetic; to select a verse that melts the heart or
      enlarges the imagination. we should vainly seek, in the poems of
      claudian, the happy invention, and artificial conduct, of an
      interesting fable; or the just and lively representation of the
      characters and situations of real life. for the service of his
      patron, he published occasional panegyrics and invectives: and
      the design of these slavish compositions encouraged his
      propensity to exceed the limits of truth and nature. these
      imperfections, however, are compensated in some degree by the
      poetical virtues of claudian. he was endowed with the rare and
      precious talent of raising the meanest, of adorning the most
      barren, and of diversifying the most similar, topics: his
      coloring, more especially in descriptive poetry, is soft and
      splendid; and he seldom fails to display, and even to abuse, the
      advantages of a cultivated understanding, a copious fancy, an
      easy, and sometimes forcible, expression; and a perpetual flow of
      harmonious versification. to these commendations, independent of
      any accidents of time and place, we must add the peculiar merit
      which claudian derived from the unfavorable circumstances of his
      birth. in the decline of arts, and of empire, a native of egypt,
      118 who had received the education of a greek, assumed, in a
      mature age, the familiar use, and absolute command, of the latin
      language; 119 soared above the heads of his feeble
      contemporaries; and placed himself, after an interval of three
      hundred years, among the poets of ancient rome. 120

      note: m. beugnot has pointed out one remarkable characteristic of
      claudians poetry, and of the timeshis extraordinary religious
      indifference. here is a poet writing at the actual crisis of the
      complete triumph of the new religion, the visible extinction of
      the old: if we may so speak, a strictly historical poet, whose
      works, excepting his mythological poem on the rape of proserpine,
      are confined to temporary subjects, and to the politics of his
      own eventful day; yet, excepting in one or two small and
      indifferent pieces, manifestly written by a christian, and
      interpolated among his poems, there is no allusion whatever to
      the great religious strife. no one would know the existence of
      christianity at that period of the world, by reading the works of
      claudian. his panegyric and his satire preserve the same
      religious impartiality; award their most lavish praise or their
      bitterest invective on christian or pagan; he insults the fall of
      eugenius, and glories in the victories of theodosius. under the
      child,and honorius never became more than a child,christianity
      continued to inflict wounds more and more deadly on expiring
      paganism. are the gods of olympus agitated with apprehension at
      the birth of this new enemy? they are introduced as rejoicing at
      his appearance, and promising long years of glory. the whole
      prophetic choir of paganism, all the oracles throughout the
      world, are summoned to predict the felicity of his reign. his

      the incapacity of a weak and distracted government may often
      assume the appearance, and produce the effects, of a treasonable
      correspondence with the public enemy. if alaric himself had been
      introduced into the council of ravenna, he would probably have
      advised the same measures which were actually pursued by the
      ministers of honorius. 1 the king of the goths would have
      conspired, perhaps with some reluctance, to destroy the
      formidable adversary, by whose arms, in italy, as well as in
      greece, he had been twice overthrown. their active and interested
      hatred laboriously accomplished the disgrace and ruin of the
      great stilicho. the valor of sarus, his fame in arms, and his
      personal, or hereditary, influence over the confederate
      barbarians, could recommend him only to the friends of their
      country, who despised, or detested, the worthless characters of
      turpilio, varanes, and vigilantius. by the pressing instances of
      the new favorites, these generals, unworthy as they had shown
      themselves of the names of soldiers, 2 were promoted to the
      command of the cavalry, of the infantry, and of the domestic
      troops. the gothic prince would have subscribed with pleasure the
      edict which the fanaticism of olympius dictated to the simple and
      devout emperor. honorius excluded all persons, who were adverse
      to the catholic church, from holding any office in the state;
      obstinately rejected the service of all those who dissented from
      his religion; and rashly disqualified many of his bravest and
      most skilful officers, who adhered to the pagan worship, or who
      had imbibed the opinions of arianism. 3 these measures, so
      advantageous to an enemy, alaric would have approved, and might
      perhaps have suggested; but it may seem doubtful, whether the
      barbarian would have promoted his interest at the expense of the
      inhuman and absurd cruelty which was perpetrated by the
      direction, or at least with the connivance of the imperial
      ministers. the foreign auxiliaries, who had been attached to the
      person of stilicho, lamented his death; but the desire of revenge
      was checked by a natural apprehension for the safety of their
      wives and children; who were detained as hostages in the strong
      cities of italy, where they had likewise deposited their most
      valuable effects. at the same hour, and as if by a common signal,
      the cities of italy were polluted by the same horrid scenes of
      universal massacre and pillage, which involved, in promiscuous
      destruction, the families and fortunes of the barbarians.
      exasperated by such an injury, which might have awakened the
      tamest and most servile spirit, they cast a look of indignation
      and hope towards the camp of alaric, and unanimously swore to
      pursue, with just and implacable war, the perfidious nation who
      had so basely violated the laws of hospitality. by the imprudent
      conduct of the ministers of honorius, the republic lost the
      assistance, and deserved the enmity, of thirty thousand of her
      bravest soldiers; and the weight of that formidable army, which
      alone might have determined the event of the war, was transferred
      from the scale of the romans into that of the goths.

      in the arts of negotiation, as well as in those of war, the
      gothic king maintained his superior ascendant over an enemy,
      whose seeming changes proceeded from the total want of counsel
      and design. from his camp, on the confines of italy, alaric
      attentively observed the revolutions of the palace, watched the
      progress of faction and discontent, disguised the hostile aspect
      of a barbarian invader, and assumed the more popular appearance
      of the friend and ally of the great stilicho: to whose virtues,
      when they were no longer formidable, he could pay a just tribute
      of sincere praise and regret. the pressing invitation of the
      malecontents, who urged the king of the goths to invade italy,
      was enforced by a lively sense of his personal injuries; and he
      might especially complain, that the imperial ministers still
      delayed and eluded the payment of the four thousand pounds of
      gold which had been granted by the roman senate, either to reward
      his services, or to appease his fury. his decent firmness was
      supported by an artful moderation, which contributed to the
      success of his designs. he required a fair and reasonable
      satisfaction; but he gave the strongest assurances, that, as soon
      as he had obtained it, he would immediately retire. he refused to
      trust the faith of the romans, unless tius and jason, the sons
      of two great officers of state, were sent as hostages to his
      camp; but he offered to deliver, in exchange, several of the
      noblest youths of the gothic nation. the modesty of alaric was
      interpreted, by the ministers of ravenna, as a sure evidence of
      his weakness and fear. they disdained either to negotiate a
      treaty, or to assemble an army; and with a rash confidence,
      derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger,
      irretrievably wasted the decisive moments of peace and war. while
      they expected, in sullen silence, that the barbarians would
      evacuate the confines of italy, alaric, with bold and rapid
      marches, passed the alps and the po; hastily pillaged the cities
      of aquileia, altinum, concordia, and cremona, which yielded to
      his arms; increased his forces by the accession of thirty
      thousand auxiliaries; and, without meeting a single enemy in the
      field, advanced as far as the edge of the morass which protected
      the impregnable residence of the emperor of the west. instead of
      attempting the hopeless siege of ravenna, the prudent leader of
      the goths proceeded to rimini, stretched his ravages along the
      sea-coast of the hadriatic, and meditated the conquest of the
      ancient mistress of the world. an italian hermit, whose zeal and
      sanctity were respected by the barbarians themselves, encountered
      the victorious monarch, and boldly denounced the indignation of
      heaven against the oppressors of the earth; but the saint himself
      was confounded by the solemn asseveration of alaric, that he felt
      a secret and praeternatural impulse, which directed, and even
      compelled, his march to the gates of rome. he felt, that his
      genius and his fortune were equal to the most arduous
      enterprises; and the enthusiasm which he communicated to the
      goths, insensibly removed the popular, and almost superstitious,
      reverence of the nations for the majesty of the roman name. his
      troops, animated by the hopes of spoil, followed the course of
      the flaminian way, occupied the unguarded passes of the apennine,
      4 descended into the rich plains of umbria; and, as they lay
      encamped on the banks of the clitumnus, might wantonly slaughter
      and devour the milk-white oxen, which had been so long reserved
      for the use of roman triumphs. a lofty situation, and a
      seasonable tempest of thunder and lightning, preserved the little
      city of narni; but the king of the goths, despising the ignoble
      prey, still advanced with unabated vigor; and after he had passed
      through the stately arches, adorned with the spoils of barbaric
      victories, he pitched his camp under the walls of rome. 6

      the saxa intercisa, a narrow passage which vespasian had cut
      through the rock, (cluver. italia antiq. tom. i. p. 168,) was
      totally neglected.

      and rome was 254 roman miles. itinerar. wesseling, p. 126.]

      during a period of six hundred and nineteen years, the seat of
      empire had never been violated by the presence of a foreign
      enemy. the unsuccessful expedition of hannibal 7 served only to
      display the character of the senate and people; of a senate
      degraded, rather than ennobled, by the comparison of an assembly
      of kings; and of a people, to whom the ambassador of pyrrhus
      ascribed the inexhaustible resources of the hydra. 8 each of the
      senators, in the time of the punic war, had accomplished his term
      of the military service, either in a subordinate or a superior
      station; and the decree, which invested with temporary command
      all those who had been consuls, or censors, or dictators, gave
      the republic the immediate assistance of many brave and
      experienced generals. in the beginning of the war, the roman
      people consisted of two hundred and fifty thousand citizens of an
      age to bear arms. 9 fifty thousand had already died in the
      defence of their country; and the twenty-three legions which were
      employed in the different camps of italy, greece, sardinia,
      sicily, and spain, required about one hundred thousand men. but
      there still remained an equal number in rome, and the adjacent
      territory, who were animated by the same intrepid courage; and
      every citizen was trained, from his earliest youth, in the
      discipline and exercises of a soldier. hannibal was astonished by
      the constancy of the senate, who, without raising the siege of
      capua, or recalling their scattered forces, expected his
      approach. he encamped on the banks of the anio, at the distance
      of three miles from the city; and he was soon informed, that the
      ground on which he had pitched his tent, was sold for an adequate
      price at a public auction; 911 and that a body of troops was
      dismissed by an opposite road, to reenforce the legions of spain.
      10 he led his africans to the gates of rome, where he found three
      armies in order of battle, prepared to receive him; but hannibal
      dreaded the event of a combat, from which he could not hope to

      from the time of the punic war, the uninterrupted succession of
      senators had preserved the name and image of the republic; and
      the degenerate subjects of honorius ambitiously derived their
      descent from the heroes who had repulsed the arms of hannibal,
      and subdued the nations of the earth. the temporal honors which
      the devout paula 11 inherited and despised, are carefully
      recapitulated by jerom, the guide of her conscience, and the
      historian of her life. the genealogy of her father, rogatus,
      which ascended as high as agamemnon, might seem to betray a
      grecian origin; but her mother, blaesilla, numbered the scipios,
      aemilius paulus, and the gracchi, in the list of her ancestors;
      and toxotius, the husband of paula, deduced his royal lineage
      from aeneas, the father of the julian line. the vanity of the
      rich, who desired to be noble, was gratified by these lofty
      pretensions. encouraged by the applause of their parasites, they
      easily imposed on the credulity of the vulgar; and were
      countenanced, in some measure, by the custom of adopting the name
      of their patron, which had always prevailed among the freedmen
      and clients of illustrious families. most of those families,
      however, attacked by so many causes of external violence or
      internal decay, were gradually extirpated; and it would be more
      reasonable to seek for a lineal descent of twenty generations,
      among the mountains of the alps, or in the peaceful solitude of
      apulia, than on the theatre of rome, the seat of fortune, of
      danger, and of perpetual revolutions. under each successive
      reign, and from every province of the empire, a crowd of hardy
      adventurers, rising to eminence by their talents or their vices,
      usurped the wealth, the honors, and the palaces of rome; and
      oppressed, or protected, the poor and humble remains of consular
      families; who were ignorant, perhaps, of the glory of their
      ancestors. 12

      11 (return) [ see jerom, tom. i. p. 169, 170, ad eustochium; he

      papyriae matris africani vera et germana propago. this particular
      description supposes a more solid title than the surname of
      julius, which toxotius shared with a thousand families of the
      western provinces. see the index of tacitus, of gruters
      inscriptions, &c.]

      12 (return) [ tacitus (annal. iii. 55) affirms, that between the
      battle of actium and the reign of vespasian, the senate was
      gradually filled with new families from the municipia and
      colonies of italy.]

      in the time of jerom and claudian, the senators unanimously
      yielded the preeminence to the anician line; and a slight view of
      their history will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of
      the noble families, which contended only for the second place. 13
      during the five first ages of the city, the name of the anicians
      was unknown; they appear to have derived their origin from
      praeneste; and the ambition of those new citizens was long
      satisfied with the plebeian honors of tribunes of the people. 14
      one hundred and sixty-eight years before the christian era, the
      family was ennobled by the prtorship of anicius, who gloriously
      terminated the illyrian war, by the conquest of the nation, and
      the captivity of their king. 15 from the triumph of that general,
      three consulships, in distant periods, mark the succession of the
      anician name. 16 from the reign of diocletian to the final
      extinction of the western empire, that name shone with a lustre
      which was not eclipsed, in the public estimation, by the majesty
      of the imperial purple. 17 the several branches, to whom it was
      communicated, united, by marriage or inheritance, the wealth and
      titles of the annian, the petronian, and the olybrian houses; and
      in each generation the number of consulships was multiplied by an
      hereditary claim. 18 the anician family excelled in faith and in
      riches: they were the first of the roman senate who embraced
      christianity; and it is probable that anicius julian, who was
      afterwards consul and prfect of the city, atoned for his
      attachment to the party of maxentius, by the readiness with which
      he accepted the religion of constantine. 19 their ample patrimony
      was increased by the industry of probus, the chief of the anician
      family; who shared with gratian the honors of the consulship, and
      exercised, four times, the high office of prtorian prfect. 20
      his immense estates were scattered over the wide extent of the
      roman world; and though the public might suspect or disapprove
      the methods by which they had been acquired, the generosity and
      magnificence of that fortunate statesman deserved the gratitude
      of his clients, and the admiration of strangers. 21 such was the
      respect entertained for his memory, that the two sons of probus,
      in their earliest youth, and at the request of the senate, were
      associated in the consular dignity; a memorable distinction,
      without example, in the annals of rome. 22

      chapter xxxi: invasion of italy, occupation of territories by
      barbarians.part ii.

      the marbles of the anician palace, were used as a proverbial
      expression of opulence and splendor; 23 but the nobles and
      senators of rome aspired, in due gradation, to imitate that
      illustrious family. the accurate description of the city, which
      was composed in the theodosian age, enumerates one thousand seven
      hundred and eighty houses, the residence of wealthy and honorable
      citizens. 24 many of these stately mansions might almost excuse
      the exaggeration of the poet; that rome contained a multitude of
      palaces, and that each palace was equal to a city: since it
      included within its own precincts every thing which could be
      subservient either to use or luxury; markets, hippodromes,
      temples, fountains, baths, porticos, shady groves, and artificial
      aviaries. 25 the historian olympiodorus, who represents the state
      of rome when it was besieged by the goths, 26 continues to
      observe, that several of the richest senators received from their
      estates an annual income of four thousand pounds of gold, above
      one hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling; without computing
      the stated provision of corn and wine, which, had they been sold,
      might have equalled in value one third of the money. compared to
      this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a thousand or
      fifteen hundred pounds of gold might be considered as no more
      than adequate to the dignity of the senatorian rank, which
      required many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind. several
      examples are recorded, in the age of honorius, of vain and
      popular nobles, who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a
      festival, which lasted seven days, and cost above one hundred
      thousand pounds sterling. 27 the estates of the roman senators,
      which so far exceeded the proportion of modern wealth, were not
      confined to the limits of italy. their possessions extended far
      beyond the ionian and aegean seas, to the most distant provinces:
      the city of nicopolis, which augustus had founded as an eternal
      monument of the actian victory, was the property of the devout
      paula; 28 and it is observed by seneca, that the rivers, which
      had divided hostile nations, now flowed through the lands of
      private citizens. 29 according to their temper and circumstances,
      the estates of the romans were either cultivated by the labor of
      their slaves, or granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to
      the industrious farmer. the economical writers of antiquity
      strenuously recommend the former method, wherever it may be
      practicable; but if the object should be removed, by its distance
      or magnitude, from the immediate eye of the master, they prefer
      the active care of an old hereditary tenant, attached to the
      soil, and interested in the produce, to the mercenary
      administration of a negligent, perhaps an unfaithful, steward. 30

      the opulent nobles of an immense capital, who were never excited
      by the pursuit of military glory, and seldom engaged in the
      occupations of civil government, naturally resigned their leisure
      to the business and amusements of private life. at rome, commerce
      was always held in contempt: but the senators, from the first age
      of the republic, increased their patrimony, and multiplied their
      clients, by the lucrative practice of usury; and the obselete
      laws were eluded, or violated, by the mutual inclinations and
      interest of both parties. 31 a considerable mass of treasure must
      always have existed at rome, either in the current coin of the
      empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were
      many sideboards in the time of pliny which contained more solid
      silver, than had been transported by scipio from vanquished
      carthage. 32 the greater part of the nobles, who dissipated their
      fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of
      wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation. their
      desires were continually gratified by the labor of a thousand
      hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were
      actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various
      professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully
      impelled by the hopes of gain. the ancients were destitute of
      many of the conveniences of life, which have been invented or
      improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of glass and
      linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of
      europe, than the senators of rome could derive from all the
      refinements of pompous or sensual luxury. 33 their luxury, and
      their manners, have been the subject of minute and laborious
      disposition: but as such inquiries would divert me too long from
      the design of the present work, i shall produce an authentic
      state of rome and its inhabitants, which is more peculiarly
      applicable to the period of the gothic invasion. ammianus
      marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the
      residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times, has
      mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation
      of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant. the
      judicious reader will not always approve of the asperity of
      censure, the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression;
      he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices, and personal
      resentments, which soured the temper of ammianus himself; but he

      the greatness of romesuch is the language of the
      historianwas founded on the rare, and almost incredible,
      alliance of virtue and of fortune. the long period of her infancy
      was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of italy,
      the neighbors and enemies of the rising city. in the strength and
      ardor of youth, she sustained the storms of war; carried her
      victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains; and brought
      home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe. at
      length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering by the
      terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and
      tranquillity. the venerable city, which had trampled on the necks
      of the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the
      perpetual guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a
      wise and wealthy parent, to devolve on the caesars, her favorite
      sons, the care of governing her ample patrimony. 35 a secure and
      profound peace, such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of
      numa, succeeded to the tumults of a republic; while rome was
      still adored as the queen of the earth; and the subject nations
      still reverenced the name of the people, and the majesty of the
      senate. but this native splendor, continues ammianus, is
      degraded, and sullied, by the conduct of some nobles, who,
      unmindful of their own dignity, and of that of their country,
      assume an unbounded license of vice and folly. they contend with
      each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames; and

      which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and
      respect. from a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory, they
      affect to multiply their likeness, in statues of bronze and
      marble; nor are they satisfied, unless those statues are covered
      with plates of gold; an honorable distinction, first granted to
      acilius the consul, after he had subdued, by his arms and
      counsels, the power of king antiochus. the ostentation of
      displaying, of magnifying, perhaps, the rent-roll of the estates
      which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the
      setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man, who
      recollects, that their poor and invincible ancestors were not
      distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers, by the delicacy
      of their food, or the splendor of their apparel. but the modern
      nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the
      loftiness of their chariots, 37 and the weighty magnificence of
      their dress. their long robes of silk and purple float in the
      wind; and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they
      occasionally discover the under garments, the rich tunics,
      embroidered with the figures of various animals. 38 followed by a
      train of fifty servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move
      along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they
      travelled with post-horses; and the example of the senators is
      boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies, whose covered
      carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the
      city and suburbs. whenever these persons of high distinction
      condescend to visit the public baths, they assume, on their
      entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate to
      their own use the conveniences which were designed for the roman
      people. if, in these places of mixed and general resort, they
      meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they
      express their affection by a tender embrace; while they proudly
      decline the salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not
      permitted to aspire above the honor of kissing their hands, or
      their knees. as soon as they have indulged themselves in the
      refreshment of the bath, they resume their rings, and the other
      ensigns of their dignity, select from their private wardrobe of
      the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons, the
      garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain till
      their departure the same haughty demeanor; which perhaps might
      have been excused in the great marcellus, after the conquest of
      syracuse. sometimes, indeed, these heroes undertake more arduous
      achievements; they visit their estates in italy, and procure
      themselves, by the toil of servile hands, the amusements of the
      chase. 39 if at any time, but more especially on a hot day, they
      have courage to sail, in their painted galleys, from the lucrine
      lake 40 to their elegant villas on the seacoast of puteoli and
      cayeta, 41 they compare their own expeditions to the marches of
      caesar and alexander. yet should a fly presume to settle on the
      silken folds of their gilded umbrellas; should a sunbeam
      penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they
      deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament, in affected
      language, that they were not born in the land of the cimmerians,
      42 the regions of eternal darkness. in these journeys into the
      country, 43 the whole body of the household marches with their
      master. in the same manner as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy
      and the light armed troops, the advanced guard and the rear, are
      marshalled by the skill of their military leaders; so the
      domestic officers, who bear a rod, as an ensign of authority,
      distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and
      attendants. the baggage and wardrobe move in the front; and are
      immediately followed by a multitude of cooks, and inferior
      ministers, employed in the service of the kitchens, and of the
      table. the main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of
      slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or
      dependent plebeians. the rear is closed by the favorite band of
      eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of
      seniority. their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of
      the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate the memory of
      semiramis, for the cruel art which she invented, of frustrating
      the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of
      future generations. in the exercise of domestic jurisdiction, the
      nobles of rome express an exquisite sensibility for any personal
      injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human
      species. when they have called for warm water, if a slave has
      been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with three
      hundred lashes: but should the same slave commit a wilful murder,
      the master will mildly observe, that he is a worthless fellow;
      but that, if he repeats the offence, he shall not escape
      punishment. hospitality was formerly the virtue of the romans;
      and every stranger, who could plead either merit or misfortune,
      was relieved, or rewarded by their generosity. at present, if a
      foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to one
      of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the
      first audience, with such warm professions, and such kind
      inquiries, that he retires, enchanted with the affability of his
      illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long
      delayed his journey to rome, the active seat of manners, as well
      as of empire. secure of a favorable reception, he repeats his
      visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery, that
      his person, his name, and his country, are already forgotten. if
      he still has resolution to persevere, he is gradually numbered in
      the train of dependants, and obtains the permission to pay his
      assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron, incapable
      of gratitude or friendship; who scarcely deigns to remark his
      presence, his departure, or his return. whenever the rich prepare
      a solemn and popular entertainment; 44 whenever they celebrate,
      with profuse and pernicious luxury, their private banquets; the
      choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation. the
      modest, the sober, and the learned, are seldom preferred; and the
      nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have
      the address to insert, in the list of invitations, the obscure
      names of the most worthless of mankind. but the frequent and
      familiar companions of the great, are those parasites, who
      practise the most useful of all arts, the art of flattery; who
      eagerly applaud each word, and every action, of their immortal
      patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated
      pavements; and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he
      is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit. at the
      roman tables, the birds, the squirrels, 45 or the fish, which
      appear of an uncommon size, are contemplated with curious
      attention; a pair of scales is accurately applied, to ascertain
      their real weight; and, while the more rational guests are
      disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition, notaries are
      summoned to attest, by an authentic record, the truth of such a
      marvelous event. another method of introduction into the houses
      and society of the great, is derived from the profession of
      gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play. the
      confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of
      friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill
      in the tesserarian art (which may be interpreted the game of dice
      and tables) 46 is a sure road to wealth and reputation. a master
      of that sublime science, who in a supper, or assembly, is placed
      below a magistrate, displays in his countenance the surprise and
      indignation which cato might be supposed to feel, when he was
      refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people. the
      acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of nobles,
      who abhor the fatigue, and disdain the advantages, of study; and
      the only books which they peruse are the satires of juvenal, and
      the verbose and fabulous histories of marius maximus. 47 the
      libraries, which they have inherited from their fathers, are
      secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day. 48 but
      the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous
      lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and
      the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly
      repeated in the palaces of rome. in those palaces, sound is
      preferred to sense, and the care of the body to that of the
      mind.

      it is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous
      suspicion of a contagious malady, is of sufficient weight to
      excuse the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the
      servants, who are despatched to make the decent inquiries, are
      not suffered to return home, till they have undergone the
      ceremony of a previous ablution. yet this selfish and unmanly
      delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of
      avarice. the prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator
      as far as spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is
      subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and
      a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the romans.
      the art of obtaining the signature of a favorable testament, and
      sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly
      understood; and it has happened, that in the same house, though
      in different apartments, a husband and a wife, with the laudable
      design of overreaching each other, have summoned their respective
      lawyers, to declare, at the same time, their mutual, but
      contradictory, intentions. the distress which follows and
      chastises extravagant luxury, often reduces the great to the use
      of the most humiliating expedients. when they desire to borrow,
      they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the
      comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the
      royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of hercules. if the
      demand is repeated, they readily procure some trusty sycophant,
      instructed to maintain a charge of poison, or magic, against the
      insolent creditor; who is seldom released from prison, till he
      has signed a discharge of the whole debt. these vices, which
      degrade the moral character of the romans, are mixed with a
      puerile superstition, that disgraces their understanding. they
      listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices, who
      pretend to read, in the entrails of victims, the signs of future
      greatness and prosperity; and there are many who do not presume
      either to bathe, or to dine, or to appear in public, till they
      have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology,
      the situation of mercury, and the aspect of the moon. 49 it is
      singular enough, that this vain credulity may often be discovered
      among the profane sceptics, who impiously doubt, or deny, the
      existence of a celestial power.

      the simple denominations of the romans were gradually lengthened
      to the number of four, five, or even seven, pompous surnames; as,

      chapter xxxi: invasion of italy, occupation of territories by
      barbarians.part iii.

      in populous cities, which are the seat of commerce and
      manufactures, the middle ranks of inhabitants, who derive their
      subsistence from the dexterity or labor of their hands, are
      commonly the most prolific, the most useful, and, in that sense,
      the most respectable part of the community. but the plebeians of
      rome, who disdained such sedentary and servile arts, had been
      oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and
      usury; and the husbandman, during the term of his military
      service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm. 50
      the lands of italy which had been originally divided among the
      families of free and indigent proprietors, were insensibly
      purchased or usurped by the avarice of the nobles; and in the age
      which preceded the fall of the republic, it was computed that
      only two thousand citizens were possessed of an independent
      substance. 51 yet as long as the people bestowed, by their
      suffrages, the honors of the state, the command of the legions,
      and the administration of wealthy provinces, their conscious
      pride alleviated in some measure, the hardships of poverty; and
      their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality
      of the candidates, who aspired to secure a venal majority in the
      thirty-five tribes, or the hundred and ninety-three centuries, of
      rome. but when the prodigal commons had not only imprudently
      alienated the use, but the inheritance of power, they sunk, under
      the reign of the caesars, into a vile and wretched populace,
      which must, in a few generations, have been totally extinguished,
      if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of
      slaves, and the influx of strangers. as early as the time of
      hadrian, it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives, that
      the capital had attracted the vices of the universe, and the
      manners of the most opposite nations. the intemperance of the
      gauls, the cunning and levity of the greeks, the savage obstinacy
      of the egyptians and jews, the servile temper of the asiatics,
      and the dissolute, effeminate prostitution of the syrians, were
      mingled in the various multitude, which, under the proud and
      false denomination of romans, presumed to despise their
      fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt beyond the
      precincts of the eternal city. 52

      whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs, 54 afforded, as
      a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome
      meat. during five months of the year, a regular allowance of
      bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual
      consumption of the capital, at a time when it was much declined
      from its former lustre, was ascertained, by an edict from
      valentinian the third, at three millions six hundred and
      twenty-eight thousand pounds. 55 iii. in the manners of
      antiquity, the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp, as well
      as for the bath; and the annual tax, which was imposed on africa
      for the benefit of rome, amounted to the weight of three millions
      of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of three hundred thousand
      english gallons. iv. the anxiety of augustus to provide the
      metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn, was not extended
      beyond that necessary article of human subsistence; and when the
      popular clamor accused the dearness and scarcity of wine, a
      proclamation was issued, by the grave reformer, to remind his
      subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst, since
      the aqueducts of agrippa had introduced into the city so many
      copious streams of pure and salubrious water. 56 this rigid
      sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous
      design of aurelian 57 does not appear to have been executed in
      its full extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and
      liberal terms. the administration of the public cellars was
      delegated to a magistrate of honorable rank; and a considerable
      part of the vintage of campania was reserved for the fortunate
      inhabitants of rome.

      but the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude,
      depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and
      spectacles. the piety of christian princes had suppressed the
      inhuman combats of gladiators; but the roman people still
      considered the circus as their home, their temple, and the seat
      of the republic. the impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to
      secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless
      and anxious night in the adjacent porticos. from the morning to
      the evening, careless of the sun, or of the rain, the spectators,
      who sometimes amounted to the number of four hundred thousand,
      remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and
      charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear, for the
      success of the colors which they espoused: and the happiness of
      rome appeared to hang on the event of a race. 61 the same
      immoderate ardor inspired their clamors and their applause, as
      often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts,
      and the various modes of theatrical representation. these
      representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered
      as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue. but
      the tragic and comic muse of the romans, who seldom aspired
      beyond the imitation of attic genius, 62 had been almost totally
      silent since the fall of the republic; 63 and their place was
      unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and
      splendid pageantry. the pantomimes, 64 who maintained their
      reputation from the age of augustus to the sixth century,
      expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the
      gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art,
      which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always
      excited the applause and wonder of the people. the vast and
      magnificent theatres of rome were filled by three thousand female
      dancers, and by three thousand singers, with the masters of the
      respective choruses. such was the popular favor which they
      enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were
      banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public
      pleasures exempted them from a law, which was strictly executed

      it is said, that the foolish curiosity of elagabalus attempted to
      discover, from the quantity of spiders webs, the number of the
      inhabitants of rome. a more rational method of inquiry might not
      have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who
      could easily have resolved a question so important for the roman
      government, and so interesting to succeeding ages. the births and
      deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of
      antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the
      common average, we might now produce some satisfactory
      calculation, which would destroy the extravagant assertions of
      critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures
      of philosophers. 66 the most diligent researches have collected
      only the following circumstances; which, slight and imperfect as
      they are, may tend, in some degree, to illustrate the question of
      the populousness of ancient rome. i. when the capital of the
      empire was besieged by the goths, the circuit of the walls was
      accurately measured, by ammonius, the mathematician, who found it
      equal to twenty-one miles. 67 it should not be forgotten that the
      form of the city was almost that of a circle; the geometrical
      figure which is known to contain the largest space within any
      given circumference. ii. the architect vitruvius, who flourished
      in the augustan age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has
      peculiar weight and authority, observes, that the innumerable
      habitations of the roman people would have spread themselves far
      beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of
      ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens
      and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice
      of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air. 68 but
      the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty
      work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and
      fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by augustus, as
      well as by nero, that the height of private edifices within the
      walls of rome, should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from
      the ground. 69 iii. juvenal 70 laments, as it should seem from
      his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom
      he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay,
      from the smoke of rome, since they might purchase, in the little
      towns of italy, a cheerful commodious dwelling, at the same price
      which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
      house-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at
      an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces
      and gardens; but the body of the roman people was crowded into a
      narrow space; and the different floors, and apartments, of the
      same house, were divided, as it is still the custom of paris, and
      other cities, among several families of plebeians. iv. the total
      number of houses in the fourteen regions of the city, is
      accurately stated in the description of rome, composed under the
      reign of theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight thousand
      three hundred and eighty-two. 71 the two classes of domus and of
      insul, into which they are divided, include all the habitations
      of the capital, of every rank and condition from the marble
      palace of the anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen
      and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodging-house, where the poet
      codrus and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret
      immediately under the tiles. if we adopt the same average, which,
      under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to paris,
      72 and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each
      house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of
      rome at twelve hundred thousand: a number which cannot be thought
      excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds
      the populousness of the greatest cities of modern europe. 73 7311

      than a million, and adds (omitting any reference to this
      passage,) that he (gibbon) could not have seriously studied the
      question. m. dureau de la malle proceeds to argue that rome, as
      contained within the walls of servius tullius, occupying an area
      only one fifth of that of paris, could not have contained 300,000
      inhabitants; within those of aurelian not more than 560,000,
      inclusive of soldiers and strangers. the suburbs, he endeavors to
      show, both up to the time of aurelian, and after his reign, were
      neither so extensive, nor so populous, as generally supposed. m.
      dureau de la malle has but imperfectly quoted the important
      passage of dionysius, that which proves that when he wrote (in
      the time of augustus) the walls of servius no longer marked the
      boundary of the city. in many places they were so built upon,
      that it was impossible to trace them. there was no certain limit,
      where the city ended and ceased to be the city; it stretched out
      to so boundless an extent into the country. ant. rom. iv. 13.
      none of m. de la malles arguments appear to me to prove, against
      this statement, that these irregular suburbs did not extend so
      far in many parts, as to make it impossible to calculate
      accurately the inhabited area of the city. though no doubt the
      city, as reconstructed by nero, was much less closely built and
      with many more open spaces for palaces, temples, and other public
      edifices, yet many passages seem to prove that the laws
      respecting the height of houses were not rigidly enforced. a
      great part of the lower especially of the slave population, were
      very densely crowded, and lived, even more than in our modern
      towns, in cellars and subterranean dwellings under the public
      edifices. nor do m. de la malles arguments, by which he would
      explain the insulae insulae (of which the notitiae urbis give us
      the number) as rows of shops, with a chamber or two within the
      domus, or houses of the wealthy, satisfy me as to their soundness
      of their scholarship. some passages which he adduces directly
      contradict his theory; none, as appears to me, distinctly prove
      it. i must adhere to the old interpretation of the word, as
      chiefly dwellings for the middling or lower classes, or clusters
      of tenements, often perhaps, under the same roof. on this point,
      zumpt, in the dissertation before quoted, entirely disagrees with
      m. de la malle. zumpt has likewise detected the mistake of m. de
      la malle as to the canon of corn, mentioned in the life of
      septimius severus by spartianus. on this canon the french writer
      calculates the inhabitants of rome at that time. but the canon
      was not the whole supply of rome, but that quantity which the
      state required for the public granaries to supply the gratuitous
      distributions to the people, and the public officers and slaves;
      no doubt likewise to keep down the general price. m. zumpt
      reckons the population of rome at 2,000,000. after careful
      consideration, i should conceive the number in the text,
      1,200,000, to be nearest the truthm. 1845.]

      such was the state of rome under the reign of honorius; at the
      time when the gothic army formed the siege, or rather the
      blockade, of the city. 74 by a skilful disposition of his
      numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an
      assault, alaric encompassed the walls, commanded the twelve
      principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent
      country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the tyber, from
      which the romans derived the surest and most plentiful supply of
      provisions. the first emotions of the nobles, and of the people,
      were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian
      should dare to insult the capital of the world: but their
      arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage,
      instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly
      exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim. perhaps in the
      person of serena, the romans might have respected the niece of
      theodosius, the aunt, nay, even the adoptive mother, of the
      reigning emperor: but they abhorred the widow of stilicho; and
      they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny,
      which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal
      correspondence with the gothic invader. actuated, or overawed, by
      the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any
      evidence of his guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
      serena was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude
      were astonished to find, that this cruel act of injustice did not
      immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians, and the
      deliverance of the city. that unfortunate city gradually
      experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid
      calamities of famine. the daily allowance of three pounds of
      bread was reduced to one half, to one third, to nothing; and the
      price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant
      proportion. the poorer citizens, who were unable to purchase the
      necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the
      rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the
      humanity of laeta, the widow of the emperor gratian, who had
      fixed her residence at rome, and consecrated to the use of the
      indigent the princely revenue which she annually received from
      the grateful successors of her husband. 75 but these private and
      temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a
      numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble
      palaces of the senators themselves. the persons of both sexes,
      who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury,
      discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of
      nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and
      silver, to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they
      would formerly have rejected with disdain. the food the most
      repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most
      unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly
      devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger. a dark
      suspicion was entertained, that some desperate wretches fed on
      the bodies of their fellow-creatures, whom they had secretly
      murdered; and even mothers, (such was the horrid conflict of the
      two most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human
      breast,) even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their
      slaughtered infants! 76 many thousands of the inhabitants of rome
      expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of
      sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were
      in the power of the enemy the stench, which arose from so many
      putrid and unburied carcasses, infected the air; and the miseries
      of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a
      pestilential disease. the assurances of speedy and effectual
      relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of
      ravenna, supported for some time, the fainting resolution of the
      romans, till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them
      to accept the offers of a praeternatural deliverance. pompeianus,
      prfect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or
      fanaticism of some tuscan diviners, that, by the mysterious force
      of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from
      the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of
      the barbarians. 77 the important secret was communicated to
      innocent, the bishop of rome; and the successor of st. peter is
      accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of
      the republic to the rigid severity of the christian worship. but
      when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was
      proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should
      be performed in the capitol, by the authority, and in the
      presence, of the magistrates, the majority of that respectable
      assembly, apprehensive either of the divine or of the imperial
      displeasure, refused to join in an act, which appeared almost
      equivalent to the public restoration of paganism. 78

      the last resource of the romans was in the clemency, or at least
      in the moderation, of the king of the goths. the senate, who in
      this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government,
      appointed two ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy. this
      important trust was delegated to basilius, a senator, of spanish
      extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of
      provinces; and to john, the first tribune of the notaries, who
      was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well
      as by his former intimacy with the gothic prince. when they were
      introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more
      lofty style than became their abject condition, that the romans
      were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war;
      and that, if alaric refused them a fair and honorable
      capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give
      battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms, and animated
      by despair. the thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed, was
      the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was
      accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his
      contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by
      luxury before they were emaciated by famine. he then condescended
      to fix the ransom, which he would accept as the price of his
      retreat from the walls of rome: all the gold and silver in the
      city, whether it were the property of the state, or of
      individuals; all the rich and precious movables; and all the
      slaves that could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
      the ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and
      suppliant tone, if such, o king, are your demands, what do you
      intend to leave us? your lives! replied the haughty conqueror:
      they trembled, and retired. yet, before they retired, a short
      suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a
      more temperate negotiation. the stern features of alaric were
      insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigor of his terms; and
      at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment
      of five thousand pounds of gold, of thirty thousand pounds of
      silver, of four thousand robes of silk, of three thousand pieces
      of fine scarlet cloth, and of three thousand pounds weight of
      pepper. 79 but the public treasury was exhausted; the annual
      rents of the great estates in italy and the provinces, had been
      exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the
      hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of
      avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only
      resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city. as soon
      as the romans had satisfied the rapacious demands of alaric, they
      were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and
      plenty. several of the gates were cautiously opened; the
      importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country
      was no longer obstructed by the goths; the citizens resorted in
      crowds to the free market, which was held during three days in
      the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful
      trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the
      city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in
      the public and private granaries. a more regular discipline than
      could have been expected, was maintained in the camp of alaric;
      and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of
      treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of
      licentious goths, who had insulted some roman citizens on the
      road to ostia. his army, enriched by the contributions of the
      capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of
      tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter quarters; and
      the gothic standard became the refuge of forty thousand barbarian
      slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the
      command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the
      disgrace of their cruel servitude. about the same time, he
      received a more honorable reenforcement of goths and huns, whom
      adolphus, 80 the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his
      pressing invitation, from the banks of the danube to those of the
      tyber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss,
      through the superior number of the imperial troops. a victorious
      leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art
      and discipline of a roman general, was at the head of a hundred
      thousand fighting men; and italy pronounced, with terror and
      respect, the formidable name of alaric. 81

      chapter xxxi: invasion of italy, occupation of territories by
      barbarians.part iv.

      at the distance of fourteen centuries, we may be satisfied with
      relating the military exploits of the conquerors of rome, without
      presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
      in the midst of his apparent prosperity, alaric was conscious,
      perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or
      perhaps the moderation which he displayed, was intended only to
      deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of
      honorius. the king of the goths repeatedly declared, that it was
      his desire to be considered as the friend of peace, and of the
      romans. three senators, at his earnest request, were sent
      ambassadors to the court of ravenna, to solicit the exchange of
      hostages, and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals,
      which he more clearly expressed during the course of the
      negotiations, could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as
      they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune. the
      barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the
      armies of the west; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and
      money; and he chose the provinces of dalmatia, noricum, and
      venetia, for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have
      commanded the important communication between italy and the
      danube. if these modest terms should be rejected, alaric showed a
      disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to
      content himself with the possession of noricum; an exhausted and
      impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the
      barbarians of germany. 82 but the hopes of peace were
      disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the
      minister olympius. without listening to the salutary
      remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under
      the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of
      honor, and too feeble for any army of defence. six thousand
      dalmatians, the flower of the imperial legions, were ordered to
      march from ravenna to rome, through an open country which was
      occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians. these brave
      legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to
      ministerial folly; their general, valens, with a hundred
      soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and one of the
      ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law
      of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of
      thirty thousand pieces of gold. yet alaric, instead of resenting
      this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals
      of peace; and the second embassy of the roman senate, which
      derived weight and dignity from the presence of innocent, bishop
      of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a
      detachment of gothic soldiers. 83

      remaining at ravenna, escaped the impending calamities of the
      city. orosius, l. vii. c. 39, p. 573.]

      olympius 84 might have continued to insult the just resentment of
      a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public
      calamities; but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues
      of the palace. the favorite eunuchs transferred the government of
      honorius, and the empire, to jovius, the prtorian prfect; an
      unworthy servant, who did not atone, by the merit of personal
      attachment, for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
      the exile, or escape, of the guilty olympius, reserved him for
      more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an
      obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a
      second time into disgrace; his ears were cut off; he expired
      under the lash; and his ignominious death afforded a grateful
      spectacle to the friends of stilicho. after the removal of
      olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious
      fanaticism, the pagans and heretics were delivered from the
      impolitic proscription, which excluded them from the dignities of
      the state. the brave gennerid, 85 a soldier of barbarian origin,
      who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been
      obliged to lay aside the military belt: and though he was
      repeatedly assured by the emperor himself, that laws were not
      made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any
      partial dispensation, and persevered in honorable disgrace, till
      he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the
      roman government. the conduct of gennerid in the important
      station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general
      of dalmatia, pannonia, noricum, and rhaetia, seemed to revive the
      discipline and spirit of the republic. from a life of idleness
      and want, his troops were soon habituated to severe exercise and
      plentiful subsistence; and his private generosity often supplied
      the rewards, which were denied by the avarice, or poverty, of the
      court of ravenna. the valor of gennerid, formidable to the
      adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bulwark of the illyrian
      frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a
      reenforcement of ten thousand huns, who arrived on the confines
      of italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a
      numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient,
      not only for the march of an army, but for the settlement of a
      colony. but the court and councils of honorius still remained a
      scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
      instigated by the prfect jovius, the guards rose in furious
      mutiny, and demanded the heads of two generals, and of the two
      principal eunuchs. the generals, under a perfidious promise of
      safety, were sent on shipboard, and privately executed; while the
      favor of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at
      milan and constantinople. eusebius the eunuch, and the barbarian
      allobich, succeeded to the command of the bed-chamber and of the
      guards; and the mutual jealousy of these subordinate ministers
      was the cause of their mutual destruction. by the insolent order
      of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was
      shamefully beaten to death with sticks, before the eyes of the
      astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of allobich,
      in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of
      his life, in which honorius discovered the faintest symptom of
      courage or resentment. yet before they fell, eusebius and
      allobich had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire, by
      opposing the conclusion of a treaty which jovius, from a selfish,
      and perhaps a criminal, motive, had negotiated with alaric, in a
      personal interview under the walls of rimini. during the absence
      of jovius, the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of
      inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation, nor his
      character, could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with
      the name of honorius, was immediately despatched to the
      prtorian prfect, granting him a free permission to dispose of
      the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military
      honors of rome to the proud demands of a barbarian. this letter
      was imprudently communicated to alaric himself; and the goth, who
      in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency,
      expressed, in the most outrageous language, his lively sense of
      the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
      the conference of rimini was hastily interrupted; and the
      prfect jovius, on his return to ravenna, was compelled to
      adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the
      court. by his advice and example, the principal officers of the
      state and army were obliged to swear, that, without listening, in
      any circumstances, to any conditions of peace, they would still
      persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of
      the republic. this rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to
      all future negotiation. the ministers of honorius were heard to
      declare, that, if they had only invoked the name of the deity,
      they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to
      the mercy of heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the
      emperor himself; they had touched, in solemn ceremony, that
      august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their
      oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and
      rebellion. 86

      the caesars; and tertullian complains, that it was the only oath
      which the romans of his time affected to reverence. see an
      elegant dissertation of the abbe mossieu on the oaths of the
      ancients, in the mem de lacademie des inscriptions, tom. i. p.

      while the emperor and his court enjoyed, with sullen pride, the
      security of the marches and fortifications of ravenna, they
      abandoned rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of
      alaric. yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or
      affected, that, as he moved with his army along the flaminian
      way, he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of italy
      to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the
      emperor, that he would save the city and its inhabitants from
      hostile fire, and the sword of the barbarians. 87 these impending
      calamities were, however, averted, not indeed by the wisdom of
      honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the gothic king; who
      employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
      instead of assaulting the capital, he successfully directed his
      efforts against the port of ostia, one of the boldest and most
      stupendous works of roman magnificence. 88 the accidents to which
      the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in
      a winter navigation, and an open road, had suggested to the
      genius of the first caesar the useful design, which was executed
      under the reign of claudius. the artificial moles, which formed
      the narrow entrance, advanced far into the sea, and firmly
      repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels
      securely rode at anchor within three deep and capacious basins,
      which received the northern branch of the tyber, about two miles
      from the ancient colony of ostia. 89 the roman port insensibly
      swelled to the size of an episcopal city, 90 where the corn of
      africa was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the
      capital. as soon as alaric was in possession of that important
      place, he summoned the city to surrender at discretion; and his
      demands were enforced by the positive declaration, that a
      refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the
      destruction of the magazines, on which the life of the roman
      people depended. the clamors of that people, and the terror of
      famine, subdued the pride of the senate; they listened, without
      reluctance, to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the
      throne of the unworthy honorius; and the suffrage of the gothic
      conqueror bestowed the purple on attalus, prfect of the city.
      the grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as
      master-general of the armies of the west; adolphus, with the rank
      of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of
      attalus; and the two hostile nations seemed to be united in the
      closest bands of friendship and alliance. 91

      the gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of
      the romans, encompassed on every side by the gothic arms, was
      conducted, in tumultuous procession, to the palace of augustus
      and trajan. after he had distributed the civil and military
      dignities among his favorites and followers, attalus convened an
      assembly of the senate; before whom, in a formal and florid
      speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of
      the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of egypt
      and the east, which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of
      rome. such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen
      with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper,
      whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which
      the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the
      barbarians. but the populace, with their usual levity, applauded
      the change of masters. the public discontent was favorable to the
      rival of honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his
      persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at
      least of toleration, from a prince, who, in his native country of
      ionia, had been educated in the pagan superstition, and who had
      since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an
      arian bishop. 92 the first days of the reign of attalus were fair
      and prosperous. an officer of confidence was sent with an
      inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of africa;
      the greatest part of italy submitted to the terror of the gothic
      powers; and though the city of bologna made a vigorous and
      effectual resistance, the people of milan, dissatisfied perhaps
      with the absence of honorius, accepted, with loud acclamations,
      the choice of the roman senate. at the head of a formidable army,
      alaric conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of
      ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers, of
      jovius, the prtorian prfect, of valens, master of the cavalry
      and infantry, of the quaestor potamius, and of julian, the first
      of the notaries, was introduced, with martial pomp, into the
      gothic camp. in the name of their sovereign, they consented to
      acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide
      the provinces of italy and the west between the two emperors.
      their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was
      aggravated by the insulting clemency of attalus, who condescended
      to promise, that, if honorius would instantly resign the purple,
      he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the
      peaceful exile of some remote island. 93 so desperate indeed did
      the situation of the son of theodosius appear, to those who were
      the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that jovius
      and valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust,
      infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and
      devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more
      fortunate rival. astonished by such examples of domestic treason,
      honorius trembled at the approach of every servant, at the
      arrival of every messenger. he dreaded the secret enemies, who
      might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bed-chamber; and some
      ships lay ready in the harbor of ravenna, to transport the
      abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the
      emperor of the east.

      92 (return) [ we may admit the evidence of sozomen for the arian
      baptism, and that of philostorgius for the pagan education, of
      attalus. the visible joy of zosimus, and the discontent which he
      imputes to the anician family, are very unfavorable to the
      christianity of the new emperor.]

      93 (return) [ he carried his insolence so far, as to declare that
      he should mutilate honorius before he sent him into exile. but
      this assertion of zosimus is destroyed by the more impartial
      testimony of olympiodorus; who attributes the ungenerous proposal
      (which was absolutely rejected by attalus) to the baseness, and
      perhaps the treachery, of jovius.]

      but there is a providence (such at least was the opinion of the
      historian procopius) 94 that watches over innocence and folly;
      and the pretensions of honorius to its peculiar care cannot
      reasonably be disputed. at the moment when his despair, incapable
      of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a
      seasonable reenforcement of four thousand veterans unexpectedly
      landed in the port of ravenna. to these valiant strangers, whose
      fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he
      committed the walls and gates of the city; and the slumbers of
      the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of
      imminent and internal danger. the favorable intelligence which
      was received from africa suddenly changed the opinions of men,
      and the state of public affairs. the troops and officers, whom
      attalus had sent into that province, were defeated and slain; and
      the active zeal of heraclian maintained his own allegiance, and
      that of his people. the faithful count of africa transmitted a
      large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the imperial
      guards; and his vigilance, in preventing the exportation of corn
      and oil, introduced famine, tumult, and discontent, into the
      walls of rome. the failure of the african expedition was the
      source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of
      attalus; and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated
      from the interest of a prince, who wanted spirit to command, or
      docility to obey. the most imprudent measures were adopted,
      without the knowledge, or against the advice, of alaric; and the
      obstinate refusal of the senate, to allow, in the embarkation,
      the mixture even of five hundred goths, betrayed a suspicious and
      distrustful temper, which, in their situation, was neither
      generous nor prudent. the resentment of the gothic king was
      exasperated by the malicious arts of jovius, who had been raised
      to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double
      perfidy, by declaring, without a blush, that he had only seemed
      to abandon the service of honorius, more effectually to ruin the
      cause of the usurper. in a large plain near rimini, and in the
      presence of an innumerable multitude of romans and barbarians,
      the wretched attalus was publicly despoiled of the diadem and
      purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by alaric, as the
      pledge of peace and friendship, to the son of theodosius. 95 the
      officers who returned to their duty, were reinstated in their
      employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was
      graciously allowed; but the degraded emperor of the romans,
      desirous of life, and insensible of disgrace, implored the
      permission of following the gothic camp, in the train of a
      haughty and capricious barbarian. 96

      the degradation of attalus removed the only real obstacle to the
      conclusion of the peace; and alaric advanced within three miles
      of ravenna, to press the irresolution of the imperial ministers,
      whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune. his
      indignation was kindled by the report, that a rival chieftain,
      that sarus, the personal enemy of adolphus, and the hereditary
      foe of the house of balti, had been received into the palace. at
      the head of three hundred followers, that fearless barbarian
      immediately sallied from the gates of ravenna; surprised, and cut
      in pieces, a considerable body of goths; reentered the city in
      triumph; and was permitted to insult his adversary, by the voice
      of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of alaric had
      forever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the
      emperor. 97 the crime and folly of the court of ravenna was
      expiated, a third time, by the calamities of rome. the king of
      the goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and
      revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the
      trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared, by a
      desperate resistance, to defray the ruin of their country. but
      they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their
      slaves and domestics; who, either from birth or interest, were
      attached to the cause of the enemy. at the hour of midnight, the
      salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were
      awakened by the tremendous sound of the gothic trumpet. eleven
      hundred and sixty-three years after the foundation of rome, the
      imperial city, which had subdued and civilized so considerable a
      part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the
      tribes of germany and scythia. 98

      the proclamation of alaric, when he forced his entrance into a
      vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of
      humanity and religion. he encouraged his troops boldly to seize
      the rewards of valor, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of
      a wealthy and effeminate people: but he exhorted them, at the
      same time, to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to
      respect the churches of the apostles, st. peter and st. paul, as
      holy and inviolable sanctuaries. amidst the horrors of a
      nocturnal tumult, several of the christian goths displayed the
      fervor of a recent conversion; and some instances of their
      uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned,
      by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers. 99 while the barbarians
      roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of
      an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the
      altar, was forced open by one of the powerful goths. he
      immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and
      silver in her possession; and was astonished at the readiness
      with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate,
      of the richest materials, and the most curious workmanship. the
      barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable
      acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition,
      addressed to him in the following words: these, said she, are
      the consecrated vessels belonging to st. peter: if you presume to
      touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
      for my part, i dare not keep what i am unable to defend. the
      gothic captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a
      messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had
      discovered; and received a peremptory order from alaric, that all
      the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported,
      without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle. from the
      extremity, perhaps, of the quirinal hill, to the distant quarter
      of the vatican, a numerous detachment of goths, marching in order
      of battle through the principal streets, protected, with
      glittering arms, the long train of their devout companions, who
      bore aloft, on their heads, the sacred vessels of gold and
      silver; and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled
      with the sound of religious psalmody. from all the adjacent
      houses, a crowd of christians hastened to join this edifying
      procession; and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of
      age, or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to
      the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the vatican. the learned
      work, concerning the city of god, was professedly composed by st.
      augustin, to justify the ways of providence in the destruction of
      the roman greatness. he celebrates, with peculiar satisfaction,
      this memorable triumph of christ; and insults his adversaries, by
      challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken
      by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able
      to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries. 100

      were both attached to the gothic cause, have repeated and
      embellished these edifying tales. according to isidore, alaric
      himself was heard to say, that he waged war with the romans, and
      not with the apostles. such was the style of the seventh century;
      two hundred years before, the fame and merit had been ascribed,

      in the sack of rome, some rare and extraordinary examples of
      barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded. but the holy
      precincts of the vatican, and the apostolic churches, could
      receive a very small proportion of the roman people; many
      thousand warriors, more especially of the huns, who served under
      the standard of alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least
      to the faith, of christ; and we may suspect, without any breach
      of charity or candor, that in the hour of savage license, when
      every passion was inflamed, and every restraint was removed, the
      precepts of the gospel seldom influenced the behavior of the
      gothic christians. the writers, the best disposed to exaggerate
      their clemency, have freely confessed, that a cruel slaughter was
      made of the romans; 101 and that the streets of the city were
      filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the
      general consternation. the despair of the citizens was sometimes
      converted into fury: and whenever the barbarians were provoked by
      opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble,
      the innocent, and the helpless. the private revenge of forty
      thousand slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the
      ignominious lashes, which they had formerly received, were washed
      away in the blood of the guilty, or obnoxious, families. the
      matrons and virgins of rome were exposed to injuries more
      dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and
      the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female
      virtue, for the admiration of future ages. 102 a roman lady, of
      singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient
      desires of a young goth, who, according to the sagacious remark
      of sozomen, was attached to the arian heresy. exasperated by her
      obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a
      lover, slightly wounded her neck. the bleeding heroine still
      continued to brave his resentment, and to repel his love, till
      the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully
      conducted her to the sanctuary of the vatican, and gave six
      pieces of gold to the guards of the church, on condition that
      they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
      such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely
      common. the brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites,
      without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their
      female captives: and a nice question of casuistry was seriously
      agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly
      refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had
      lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity. 103
      their were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind, and
      more general concern. it cannot be presumed, that all the
      barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous
      outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity,
      protected the greatest part of the roman women from the danger of
      a rape. but avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since
      the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to
      the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by
      the possession of wealth. in the pillage of rome, a just
      preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the
      greatest value in the smallest compass and weight: but, after
      these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent
      robbers, the palaces of rome were rudely stripped of their
      splendid and costly furniture. the sideboards of massy plate, and
      the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly
      piled in the wagons, that always followed the march of a gothic
      army. the most exquisite works of art were roughly handled, or
      wantonly destroyed; many a statue was melted for the sake of the
      precious materials; and many a vase, in the division of the
      spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battle-axe.

      the acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of
      the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded, by threats, by blows,
      and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of
      hidden treasure. 104 visible splendor and expense were alleged as
      the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was
      imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some
      misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would
      discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many
      unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash, for refusing to
      reveal their imaginary treasures. the edifices of rome, though
      the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from
      the violence of the goths. at their entrance through the salarian
      gate, they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march, and to
      distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which
      encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed
      many private and public buildings; and the ruins of the palace of
      sallust 105 remained, in the age of justinian, a stately monument
      of the gothic conflagration. 106 yet a contemporary historian has
      observed, that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of
      solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to
      subvert the foundations of ancient structures. some truth may
      possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of
      heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage; and that the
      proud forum of rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods
      and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.

      chapter xxxi: invasion of italy, occupation of territories by
      barbarians.part v.

      whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank, who
      perished in the massacre of rome, it is confidently affirmed that
      only one senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy. 108 but
      it was not easy to compute the multitudes, who, from an honorable
      station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the
      miserable condition of captives and exiles. as the barbarians had
      more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate
      price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom
      was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the
      charity of strangers. 109 the captives, who were regularly sold,
      either in open market, or by private contract, would have legally
      regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a
      citizen to lose, or to alienate. 110 but as it was soon
      discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger
      their lives; and that the goths, unless they were tempted to
      sell, might be provoked to murder, their useless prisoners; the
      civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise
      regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate
      term of five years, till they had discharged by their labor the
      price of their redemption. 111 the nations who invaded the roman
      empire, had driven before them, into italy, whole troops of
      hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude
      than of famine. the calamities of rome and italy dispersed the
      inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant
      places of refuge. while the gothic cavalry spread terror and
      desolation along the sea-coast of campania and tuscany, the
      little island of igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the
      argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile
      attempts; and at so small a distance from rome, great numbers of
      citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that
      sequestered spot. 112 the ample patrimonies, which many
      senatorian families possessed in africa, invited them, if they
      had time, and prudence, to escape from the ruin of their country,
      to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province. the most
      illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious proba, 113
      the widow of the prfect petronius. after the death of her
      husband, the most powerful subject of rome, she had remained at
      the head of the anician family, and successively supplied, from
      her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her three
      sons. when the city was besieged and taken by the goths, proba
      supported, with christian resignation, the loss of immense
      riches; embarked in a small vessel, from whence she beheld, at
      sea, the flames of her burning palace, and fled with her daughter
      laeta, and her granddaughter, the celebrated virgin, demetrias,
      to the coast of africa. the benevolent profusion with which the
      matron distributed the fruits, or the price, of her estates,
      contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
      but even the family of proba herself was not exempt from the
      rapacious oppression of count heraclian, who basely sold, in
      matrimonial prostitution, the noblest maidens of rome to the lust
      or avarice of the syrian merchants. the italian fugitives were
      dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of egypt and
      asia, as far as constantinople and jerusalem; and the village of
      bethlem, the solitary residence of st. jerom and his female
      converts, was crowded with illustrious beggars of either sex, and
      every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance
      of their past fortune. 114 this awful catastrophe of rome filled
      the astonished empire with grief and terror. so interesting a
      contrast of greatness and ruin, disposed the fond credulity of
      the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of
      the queen of cities. the clergy, who applied to recent events the
      lofty metaphors of oriental prophecy, were sometimes tempted to
      confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of
      the globe.

      there exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate
      the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
      yet, when the first emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate
      was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious
      contemporaries were forced to confess, that infant rome had
      formerly received more essential injury from the gauls, than she
      had now sustained from the goths in her declining age. 115 the
      experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a
      much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that
      the ravages of the barbarians, whom alaric had led from the banks
      of the danube, were less destructive than the hostilities
      exercised by the troops of charles the fifth, a catholic prince,
      who styled himself emperor of the romans. 116 the goths evacuated
      the city at the end of six days, but rome remained above nine
      months in the possession of the imperialists; and every hour was
      stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine. the
      authority of alaric preserved some order and moderation among the
      ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and
      king; but the constable of bourbon had gloriously fallen in the
      attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every
      restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of three
      independent nations, the italians, the spaniards, and the
      germans. in the beginning of the sixteenth century, the manners
      of italy exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of
      mankind. they united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an
      unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring
      from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who
      had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to
      assault the palace of the roman pontiff, must deserve to be
      considered as the most profligate of the italians. at the same
      era, the spaniards were the terror both of the old and new
      world: but their high-spirited valor was disgraced by gloomy
      pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty. indefatigable
      in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated
      practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing
      their prisoners: many of the castilians, who pillaged rome, were
      familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps,
      were lately returned from the conquest of mexico. the germans were
      less corrupt than the italians, less cruel than the spaniards;
      and the rustic, or even savage, aspect of those tramontane
      warriors, often disguised a simple and merciful disposition. but
      they had imbibed, in the first fervor of the reformation, the
      spirit, as well as the principles, of luther. it was their
      favorite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects
      of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse,
      a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and
      degree, who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of
      modern rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the
      throne of anti-christ, to purify, with blood and fire, the
      abominations of the spiritual babylon. 117

      the retreat of the victorious goths, who evacuated rome on the
      sixth day, 118 might be the result of prudence; but it was not
      surely the effect of fear. 119 at the head of an army encumbered
      with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced
      along the appian way into the southern provinces of italy,
      destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting
      himself with the plunder of the unresisting country. the fate of
      capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of campania, and which
      was respected, even in its decay, as the eighth city of the
      empire, 120 is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of
      nola 121 has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity
      of paulinus, 122 who was successively a consul, a monk, and a
      bishop. at the age of forty, he renounced the enjoyment of wealth
      and honor, of society and literature, to embrace a life of
      solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy
      encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends,
      who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or
      body. 123 an early and passionate attachment determined him to
      fix his humble dwelling in one of the suburbs of nola, near the
      miraculous tomb of st. faelix, which the public devotion had
      already surrounded with five large and populous churches. the
      remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated
      to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day
      of his festival, paulinus never failed to celebrate by a solemn
      hymn; and in whose name he erected a sixth church, of superior
      elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious
      pictures, from the history of the old and new testament. such
      assiduous zeal secured the favor of the saint, 124 or at least of
      the people; and, after fifteen years retirement, the roman
      consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of nola, a few
      months before the city was invested by the goths. during the
      siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen,
      either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar
      patron; yet it soon appeared by the event, that faelix wanted
      power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had
      formerly been the shepherd. nola was not saved from the general
      devastation; 125 and the captive bishop was protected only by the
      general opinion of his innocence and poverty. above four years
      elapsed from the successful invasion of italy by the arms of
      alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the goths under the conduct
      of his successor adolphus; and, during the whole time, they
      reigned without control over a country, which, in the opinion of
      the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature
      and art. the prosperity, indeed, which italy had attained in the
      auspicious age of the antonines, had gradually declined with the
      decline of the empire.

      the fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the
      barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the
      more elegant refinements of luxury, which had been prepared for
      the use of the soft and polished italians. each soldier, however,
      claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and
      cattle, oil and wine, that was daily collected and consumed in
      the gothic camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas
      and gardens, once inhabited by lucullus and cicero, along the
      beauteous coast of campania. their trembling captives, the sons
      and daughters of roman senators, presented, in goblets of gold
      and gems, large draughts of falernian wine to the haughty
      victors; who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of
      plane-trees, 126 artificially disposed to exclude the scorching
      rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun. these delights
      were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of
      their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of scythia, and the
      frozen banks of the elbe and danube, added new charms to the
      felicity of the italian climate. 127

      chapter xxxi: invasion of italy, occupation of territories by
      barbarians.part vi.

      the personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians
      were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the
      brave adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarch, was
      unanimously elected to succeed to his throne. the character and
      political system of the new king of the goths may be best
      understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen
      of narbonne; who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the holy land,
      related it to st. jerom, in the presence of the historian
      orosius. in the full confidence of valor and victory, i once
      aspired (said adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to
      obliterate the name of rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion
      of the goths; and to acquire, like augustus, the immortal fame of
      the founder of a new empire. by repeated experiments, i was
      gradually convinced, that laws are essentially necessary to
      maintain and regulate a well-constituted state; and that the
      fierce, untractable humor of the goths was incapable of bearing
      the salutary yoke of laws and civil government. from that moment
      i proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition;
      and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages
      should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the
      sword of the goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain,
      the prosperity of the roman empire. 130 with these pacific
      views, the successor of alaric suspended the operations of war;
      and seriously negotiated with the imperial court a treaty of
      friendship and alliance. it was the interest of the ministers of
      honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their
      extravagant oath, to deliver italy from the intolerable weight of
      the gothic powers; and they readily accepted their service
      against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces
      beyond the alps. 131 adolphus, assuming the character of a roman
      general, directed his march from the extremity of campania to the
      southern provinces of gaul. his troops, either by force or
      agreement, immediately occupied the cities of narbonne,
      thoulouse, and bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by count
      boniface from the walls of marseilles, they soon extended their
      quarters from the mediterranean to the ocean.

      the oppressed provincials might exclaim, that the miserable
      remnant, which the enemy had spared, was cruelly ravished by
      their pretended allies; yet some specious colors were not wanting
      to palliate, or justify the violence of the goths. the cities of
      gaul, which they attacked, might perhaps be considered as in a
      state of rebellion against the government of honorius: the
      articles of the treaty, or the secret instructions of the court,
      might sometimes be alleged in favor of the seeming usurpations of
      adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular, unsuccessful act of
      hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth,
      to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host, impatient of
      peace or discipline. the luxury of italy had been less effectual
      to soften the temper, than to relax the courage, of the goths;
      and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and
      institutions, of civilized society. 132

      adolphus visited and plundered rome a second time, (more
      locustarum erasit) yet he agrees with orosius in supposing that a
      treaty of peace was concluded between the gothic prince and
      honorius. see oros. l. vii. c. 43 p. 584, 585. jornandes, de reb.

      132 (return) [ the retreat of the goths from italy, and their
      first transactions in gaul, are dark and doubtful. i have derived
      much assistance from mascou, (hist. of the ancient germans, l.
      viii. c. 29, 35, 36, 37,) who has illustrated, and connected, the
      broken chronicles and fragments of the times.]

      the professions of adolphus were probably sincere, and his
      attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the
      ascendant which a roman princess had acquired over the heart and
      understanding of the barbarian king. placidia, 133 the daughter
      of the great theodosius, and of galla, his second wife, had
      received a royal education in the palace of constantinople; but
      the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions
      which agitated the western empire under the reign of her brother
      honorius. when rome was first invested by the arms of alaric,
      placidia, who was then about twenty years of age, resided in the
      city; and her ready consent to the death of her cousin serena has
      a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the
      circumstances of the action, may be aggravated, or excused, by
      the consideration of her tender age. 134 the victorious
      barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive, 135 the
      sister of honorius; but, while she was exposed to the disgrace of
      following round italy the motions of a gothic camp, she
      experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment. the
      authority of jornandes, who praises the beauty of placidia, may
      perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive
      silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendor of her birth, the
      bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous
      insinuation which she condescended to employ, made a deep
      impression on the mind of adolphus; and the gothic king aspired
      to call himself the brother of the emperor. the ministers of
      honorius rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so
      injurious to every sentiment of roman pride; and repeatedly urged
      the restitution of placidia, as an indispensable condition of the
      treaty of peace. but the daughter of theodosius submitted,
      without reluctance, to the desires of the conqueror, a young and
      valiant prince, who yielded to alaric in loftiness of stature,
      but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and
      beauty. the marriage of adolphus and placidia 136 was consummated
      before the goths retired from italy; and the solemn, perhaps the
      anniversary day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in
      the house of ingenuus, one of the most illustrious citizens of
      narbonne in gaul. the bride, attired and adorned like a roman
      empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the
      goths, who assumed, on this occasion, the roman habit, contented
      himself with a less honorable seat by her side. the nuptial gift,
      which, according to the custom of his nation, 137 was offered to
      placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her
      country. fifty beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin
      in each hand; and one of these basins was filled with pieces of
      gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
      attalus, so long the sport of fortune, and of the goths, was
      appointed to lead the chorus of the hymeneal song; and the
      degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful
      musician. the barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph;
      and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by
      the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their
      gothic lord. 138

      allowed the morgingcap immediately after the wedding night; and
      this famous gift, the reward of virginity might equal the fourth
      part of the husbands substance. some cautious maidens, indeed,
      were wise enough to stipulate beforehand a present, which they
      were too sure of not deserving. see montesquieu, esprit des loix,

      the hundred basins of gold and gems, presented to placidia at her
      nuptial feast, formed an inconsiderable portion of the gothic
      treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected
      from the history of the successors of adolphus. many curious and
      costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found
      in their palace of narbonne, when it was pillaged, in the sixth
      century, by the franks: sixty cups, or chalices; fifteen patens,
      or plates, for the use of the communion; twenty boxes, or cases,
      to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth 139 was
      distributed by the son of clovis among the churches of his
      dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former
      sacrilege of the goths. they possessed, with more security of
      conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service
      of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of five hundred
      pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the
      exquisite workmanship, and the tradition, that it had been
      presented by tius, the patrician, to torismond, king of the
      goths. one of the successors of torismond purchased the aid of
      the french monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift. when
      he was seated on the throne of spain, he delivered it with
      reluctance to the ambassadors of dagobert; despoiled them on the
      road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom
      of two hundred thousand pieces of gold; and preserved the
      missorium, as the pride of the gothic treasury. 140 when that
      treasury, after the conquest of spain, was plundered by the
      arabs, they admired, and they have celebrated, another object
      still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of one
      single piece of solid emerald, 141 encircled with three rows of
      fine pearls, supported by three hundred and sixty-five feet of
      gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of five hundred
      thousand pieces of gold. 142 some portion of the gothic treasures
      might be the gift of friendship, or the tribute of obedience; but
      the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the
      spoils of the empire, and perhaps of rome.

      after the deliverance of italy from the oppression of the goths,
      some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the
      palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country. 143 by a
      wise and humane regulation, the eight provinces which had been
      the most deeply injured, campania, tuscany, picenum, samnium,
      apulia, calabria, bruttium, and lucania, obtained an indulgence
      of five years: the ordinary tribute was reduced to one fifth, and
      even that fifth was destined to restore and support the useful
      institution of the public posts. by another law, the lands which
      had been left without inhabitants or cultivation, were granted,
      with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbors who should
      occupy, or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new
      possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive
      proprietors. about the same time a general amnesty was published
      in the name of honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all
      the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy
      subjects, during the term of the public disorder and calamity. a
      decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of
      the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices
      which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and
      extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of
      africa. the crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the
      barbarians, were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and
      pleasure; and albinus, prfect of rome, informed the court, with
      some anxiety and surprise, that, in a single day, he had taken an
      account of the arrival of fourteen thousand strangers. 144 in
      less than seven years, the vestiges of the gothic invasion were
      almost obliterated; and the city appeared to resume its former
      splendor and tranquillity. the venerable matron replaced her
      crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war; and
      was still amused, in the last moment of her decay, with the
      prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion. 145

      their city; and the chronicle of prosper commends heraclian, qui
      in romanae urbis reparationem strenuum exhibuerat ministerium.]

      145 (return) [ the date of the voyage of claudius rutilius
      numatianus is clogged with some difficulties; but scaliger has

      of september and embarked at porto the 9th of october, a.d. 416.
      see tillemont, hist. des empereurs, tom, v. p. 820. in this
      poetical itinerary, rutilius (l. i. 115, &c.) addresses rome in a
      high strain of congratulation:

      erige crinales lauros, seniumque sacrati verticis in virides,
      roma, recinge comas, &c.]

      this apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of
      a hostile armament from the country which afforded the daily
      subsistence of the roman people. heraclian, count of africa, who,
      under the most difficult and distressful circumstances, had
      supported, with active loyalty, the cause of honorius, was
      tempted, in the year of his consulship, to assume the character
      of a rebel, and the title of emperor. the ports of africa were
      immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he
      prepared to invade italy: and his fleet, when it cast anchor at
      the mouth of the tyber, indeed surpassed the fleets of xerxes and
      alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley, and
      the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number
      of three thousand two hundred. 146 yet with such an armament,
      which might have subverted, or restored, the greatest empires of
      the earth, the african usurper made a very faint and feeble
      impression on the provinces of his rival. as he marched from the
      port, along the road which leads to the gates of rome, he was
      encountered, terrified, and routed, by one of the imperial
      captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune
      and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship. 147 when
      heraclian landed in the harbor of carthage, he found that the
      whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned
      to their allegiance. the rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple
      of memory; his consulship was abolished: 148 and the remains of
      his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of four
      thousand pounds of gold, were granted to the brave constantius,
      who had already defended the throne, which he afterwards shared
      with his feeble sovereign. honorius viewed, with supine
      indifference, the calamities of rome and italy; 149 but the
      rebellious attempts of attalus and heraclian, against his
      personal safety, awakened, for a moment, the torpid instinct of
      his nature. he was probably ignorant of the causes and events
      which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as italy
      was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he
      peaceably existed in the palace of ravenna, while the tyrants
      beyond the alps were repeatedly vanquished in the name, and by
      the lieutenants, of the son of theodosius. 150 in the course of a
      busy and interesting narrative i might possibly forget to mention
      the death of such a prince: and i shall therefore take the
      precaution of observing, in this place, that he survived the last
      siege of rome about thirteen years.

      years after the event; yet his authority seems to be overbalanced

      that it was not a favorite chicken of that name, but only the
      capital of the world, which had been lost. yet even this story is

      the usurpation of constantine, who received the purple from the
      legions of britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
      his title was acknowledged, from the wall of antoninus to the
      columns of hercules; and, in the midst of the public disorder he
      shared the dominion, and the plunder, of gaul and spain, with the
      tribes of barbarians, whose destructive progress was no longer
      checked by the rhine or pyrenees. stained with the blood of the
      kinsmen of honorius, he extorted, from the court of ravenna, with
      which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his
      rebellious claims. constantine engaged himself, by a solemn
      promise, to deliver italy from the goths; advanced as far as the
      banks of the po; and after alarming, rather than assisting, his
      pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of arles, to
      celebrate, with intemperate luxury, his vain and ostentatious
      triumph. but this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and
      destroyed by the revolt of count gerontius, the bravest of his
      generals; who, during the absence of his son constans, a prince
      already invested with the imperial purple, had been left to
      command in the provinces of spain. from some reason, of which we
      are ignorant, gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed
      it on the head of his friend maximus, who fixed his residence at
      tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards, through the
      pyrenees, to surprise the two emperors, constantine and constans,
      before they could prepare for their defence. the son was made
      prisoner at vienna, and immediately put to death: and the
      unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation
      of his family; which had tempted, or compelled him,
      sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic
      life. the father maintained a siege within the walls of arles;
      but those walls must have yielded to the assailants, had not the
      city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an italian
      army. the name of honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor,
      astonished the contending parties of the rebels. gerontius,
      abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of spain;
      and rescued his name from oblivion, by the roman courage which
      appeared to animate the last moments of his life. in the middle
      of the night, a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded
      and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded. his
      wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the alani, and some
      faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used,
      with so much skill and resolution, a large magazine of darts and
      arrows, that above three hundred of the assailants lost their
      lives in the attempt. his slaves when all the missile weapons
      were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and gerontius, if he had not
      been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their
      example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate
      resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house. in this fatal
      extremity, he complied with the request of his barbarian friend,
      and cut off his head. the wife of gerontius, who conjured him not
      to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly
      presented her neck to his sword; and the tragic scene was
      terminated by the death of the count himself, who, after three
      ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger, and sheathed it in his
      heart. 151 the unprotected maximus, whom he had invested with the
      purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was
      entertained of his power and abilities. the caprice of the
      barbarians, who ravaged spain, once more seated this imperial
      phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice
      of honorius; and the tyrant maximus, after he had been shown to
      the people of ravenna and rome, was publicly executed.

      151 (return) [ the praises which sozomen has bestowed on this act
      of despair, appear strange and scandalous in the mouth of an
      ecclesiastical historian. he observes (p. 379) that the wife of
      gerontius was a christian; and that her death was worthy of her
      religion, and of immortal fame.]

      the general, (constantius was his name,) who raised by his
      approach the siege of arles, and dissipated the troops of
      gerontius, was born a roman; and this remarkable distinction is
      strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the
      subjects of the empire. the strength and majesty which were
      conspicuous in the person of that general, 152 marked him, in the
      popular opinion, as a candidate worthy of the throne, which he
      afterwards ascended. in the familiar intercourse of private life,
      his manners were cheerful and engaging; nor would he sometimes
      disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the
      pantomimes themselves, in the exercises of their ridiculous
      profession. but when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he
      mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular
      practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large
      animated eyes round the field, constantius then struck terror
      into his foes, and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of
      victory. he had received from the court of ravenna the important
      commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the west;
      and the pretended emperor constantine, after enjoying a short and
      anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of
      a more formidable enemy. yet this interval allowed time for a
      successful negotiation with the franks and alemanni and his
      ambassador, edobic, soon returned at the head of an army, to
      disturb the operations of the siege of arles. the roman general,
      instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly and perhaps
      wisely, resolved to pass the rhone, and to meet the barbarians.
      his measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that,
      while they engaged the infantry of constantius in the front, they
      were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed, by the cavalry
      of his lieutenant ulphilas, who had silently gained an
      advantageous post in their rear. the remains of the army of
      edobic were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader
      escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless
      friend; who too clearly understood, that the head of his
      obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for
      the imperial general. on this occasion, constantius behaved with
      the magnanimity of a genuine roman. subduing, or suppressing,
      every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit
      and services of ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the
      assassin of edobic; and sternly intimated his commands, that the
      camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an
      ungrateful wretch, who had violated the laws of friendship and
      hospitality. the usurper, who beheld, from the walls of arles,
      the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence
      in so generous a conqueror. he required a solemn promise for his
      security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the
      sacred character of a christian presbyter, he ventured to open
      the gates of the city. but he soon experienced that the
      principles of honor and integrity, which might regulate the
      ordinary conduct of constantius, were superseded by the loose
      doctrines of political morality. the roman general, indeed,
      refused to sully his laurels with the blood of constantine; but
      the abdicated emperor, and his son julian, were sent under a
      strong guard into italy; and before they reached the palace of
      ravenna, they met the ministers of death.

      152 (return) [ it is the expression of olympiodorus, which he

      ii. p. 443, ver 38.) this allusion may prove, that the ancient
      tragic poets were still familiar to the greeks of the fifth
      century.]

      at a time when it was universally confessed, that almost every
      man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes
      whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a
      rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their
      predecessors, still continued to arise. this mischief was
      peculiarly felt in the provinces of spain and gaul, where the
      principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war
      and rebellion. before constantine resigned the purple, and in the
      fourth month of the siege of arles, intelligence was received in
      the imperial camp, that jovinus has assumed the diadem at mentz,
      in the upper germany, at the instigation of goar, king of the
      alani, and of guntiarius, king of the burgundians; and that the
      candidate, on whom they had bestowed the empire, advanced with a
      formidable host of barbarians, from the banks of the rhine to
      those of the rhone. every circumstance is dark and extraordinary
      in the short history of the reign of jovinus. it was natural to
      expect, that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a
      victorious army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the
      justice of the cause of honorius. the hasty retreat of
      constantius might be justified by weighty reasons; but he
      resigned, without a struggle, the possession of gaul; and
      dardanus, the prtorian prfect, is recorded as the only
      magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper. 153
      when the goths, two years after the siege of rome, established
      their quarters in gaul, it was natural to suppose that their
      inclinations could be divided only between the emperor honorius,
      with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded
      attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional
      purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch. yet in a
      moment of disgust, (for which it is not easy to assign a cause,
      or a date,) adolphus connected himself with the usurper of gaul;
      and imposed on attalus the ignominious task of negotiating the
      treaty, which ratified his own disgrace. we are again surprised
      to read, that, instead of considering the gothic alliance as the
      firmest support of his throne, jovinus upbraided, in dark and
      ambiguous language, the officious importunity of attalus; that,
      scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the
      purple his brother sebastian; and that he most imprudently
      accepted the service of sarus, when that gallant chief, the
      soldier of honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a
      prince, who knew not how to reward or punish. adolphus, educated
      among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the
      most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced
      with a body of ten thousand goths to encounter the hereditary
      enemy of the house of balti. he attacked sarus at an unguarded
      moment, when he was accompanied only by eighteen or twenty of his
      valiant followers. united by friendship, animated by despair, but
      at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved
      the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies;
      and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils, 154 than he was
      instantly despatched. the death of sarus dissolved the loose
      alliance which adolphus still maintained with the usurpers of
      gaul. he again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and
      soon satisfied the brother of placidia, by the assurance that he
      would immediately transmit to the palace of ravenna the heads of
      the two tyrants, jovinus and sebastian. the king of the goths
      executed his promise without difficulty or delay; the helpless
      brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by
      their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of valentia
      was expiated by the ruin of one of the noblest cities of gaul.
      the emperor, chosen by the roman senate, who had been promoted,
      degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted,
      was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the gothic king
      withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt,
      from offering any violence to the person of attalus. the
      unfortunate attalus, who was left without subjects or allies,
      embarked in one of the ports of spain, in search of some secure
      and solitary retreat: but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to
      the presence of honorius, led in triumph through the streets of
      rome or ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on
      the second step of the throne of his invincible conqueror. the
      same measure of punishment, with which, in the days of his
      prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted
      on attalus himself; he was condemned, after the amputation of two
      fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of lipari, where he was
      supplied with the decent necessaries of life. the remainder of
      the reign of honorius was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be
      observed, that, in the space of five years, seven usurpers had
      yielded to the fortune of a prince, who was himself incapable
      either of counsel or of action.

      chapter xxxi: invasion of italy, occupation of territories by
      barbarians.part vii.

      the situation of spain, separated, on all sides, from the enemies
      of rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate
      provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and
      sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of
      domestic happiness, that, in a period of four hundred years,
      spain furnished very few materials to the history of the roman
      empire. the footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of
      gallienus, had penetrated beyond the pyrenees, were soon
      obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of
      the christian era, the cities of emerita, or merida, of corduba,
      seville, bracara, and tarragona, were numbered with the most
      illustrious of the roman world. the various plenty of the animal,
      the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and
      manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the
      peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an
      extensive and profitable trade. 155 the arts and sciences
      flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the
      character of the spaniards was enfeebled by peace and servitude,
      the hostile approach of the germans, who had spread terror and
      desolation from the rhine to the pyrenees, seemed to rekindle
      some sparks of military ardor. as long as the defence of the
      mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the
      country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the
      barbarians. but no sooner had the national troops been compelled
      to resign their post to the honorian bands, in the service of
      constantine, than the gates of spain were treacherously betrayed
      to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of rome by
      the goths. 156 the consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of
      rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the pyrenees to desert
      their station; to invite the arms of the suevi, the vandals, and
      the alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with
      irresistible violence from the frontiers of gaul to the sea of
      africa. the misfortunes of spain may be described in the language
      of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the
      passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary
      writers. 157 the irruption of these nations was followed by the
      most dreadful calamities; as the barbarians exercised their
      indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the romans and the
      spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open
      country. the progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants
      to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild
      beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were
      exasperated, by the taste of blood, and the impatience of hunger,
      boldly to attack and devour their human prey. pestilence soon
      appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion
      of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited
      only the envy of their surviving friends. at length the
      barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by
      the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed
      their permanent seats in the depopulated country. the ancient
      gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of old castille, was
      divided between the suevi and the vandals; the alani were
      scattered over the provinces of carthagena and lusitania, from
      the mediterranean to the atlantic ocean; and the fruitful
      territory of boetica was allotted to the silingi, another branch
      of the vandalic nation. after regulating this partition, the
      conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal
      engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again
      cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a
      captive people. the greatest part of the spaniards was even
      disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism,
      to the severe oppressions of the roman government; yet there were
      many who still asserted their native freedom; and who refused,
      more especially in the mountains of gallicia, to submit to the
      barbarian yoke. 158

      the important present of the heads of jovinus and sebastian had
      approved the friendship of adolphus, and restored gaul to the
      obedience of his brother honorius. peace was incompatible with
      the situation and temper of the king of the goths. he readily
      accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the
      barbarians of spain; the troops of constantius intercepted his
      communication with the seaports of gaul, and gently pressed his
      march towards the pyrenees: 159 he passed the mountains, and
      surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of barcelona. the
      fondness of adolphus for his roman bride, was not abated by time
      or possession: and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his
      illustrious grandsire, theodosius, appeared to fix him forever in
      the interest of the republic. the loss of that infant, whose
      remains were deposited in a silver coffin in one of the churches
      near barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the
      gothic king was suspended by the labors of the field; and the
      course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.

      he had imprudently received into his service one of the followers
      of sarus; a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive
      stature; whose secret desire of revenging the death of his
      beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his
      insolent master. adolphus was assassinated in the palace of
      barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a
      tumultuous faction; 160 and a stranger to the royal race,
      singeric, the brother of sarus himself, was seated on the gothic
      throne. the first act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the
      six children of adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he
      tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
      161 the unfortunate placidia, instead of the respectful
      compassion, which she might have excited in the most savage
      breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult. the daughter
      of the emperor theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar
      captives, was compelled to march on foot above twelve miles,
      before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of a husband whom
      placidia loved and lamented. 162

      huns, commanded the tribes of the ostrogoths in some distant

      of the latins.]

      but placidia soon obtained the pleasure of revenge, and the view
      of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people
      against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of
      his usurpation. after the death of singeric, the free choice of
      the nation bestowed the gothic sceptre on wallia; whose warlike
      and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign,
      extremely hostile to the republic. he marched in arms from
      barcelona to the shores of the atlantic ocean, which the ancients
      revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world. but when he
      reached the southern promontory of spain, 163 and, from the rock
      now covered by the fortress of gibraltar, contemplated the
      neighboring and fertile coast of africa, wallia resumed the
      designs of conquest, which had been interrupted by the death of
      alaric. the winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of
      the goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply
      affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks. in
      this disposition the successor of adolphus no longer refused to
      listen to a roman ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by
      the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the
      conduct of the brave constantius. a solemn treaty was stipulated
      and observed; placidia was honorably restored to her brother; six
      hundred thousand measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry
      goths; 164 and wallia engaged to draw his sword in the service of
      the empire. a bloody war was instantly excited among the
      barbarians of spain; and the contending princes are said to have
      addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages,
      to the throne of the western emperor, exhorting him to remain a
      tranquil spectator of their contest; the events of which must be
      favorable to the romans, by the mutual slaughter of their common
      enemies. 165 the spanish war was obstinately supported, during
      three campaigns, with desperate valor, and various success; and
      the martial achievements of wallia diffused through the empire
      the superior renown of the gothic hero. he exterminated the
      silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the
      province of boetica. he slew, in battle, the king of the alani;
      and the remains of those scythian wanderers, who escaped from the
      field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge
      under the standard of the vandals, with whom they were ever
      afterwards confounded. the vandals themselves, and the suevi,
      yielded to the efforts of the invincible goths. the promiscuous
      multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were
      driven into the mountains of gallicia; where they still
      continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise
      their domestic and implacable hostilities. in the pride of
      victory, wallia was faithful to his engagements: he restored his
      spanish conquests to the obedience of honorius; and the tyranny
      of the imperial officers soon reduced an oppressed people to
      regret the time of their barbarian servitude. while the event of
      the war was still doubtful, the first advantages obtained by the
      arms of wallia had encouraged the court of ravenna to decree the
      honors of a triumph to their feeble sovereign. he entered rome
      like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of
      servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which
      they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and
      orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the
      wisdom, and the invincible courage, of the emperor honorius. 166

      such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of
      rome, if wallia, before he repassed the pyrenees, had extirpated
      the seeds of the spanish war. his victorious goths, forty-three
      years after they had passed the danube, were established,
      according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the
      second aquitain; a maritime province between the garonne and the
      loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of
      bourdeaux. that metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade
      of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its
      numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the gauls by their
      wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners. the
      adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden
      of eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil, and a temperate
      climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the
      rewards of industry; and the goths, after their martial toils,
      luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of aquitain. 167 the
      gothic limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some
      neighboring dioceses; and the successors of alaric fixed their
      royal residence at thoulouse, which included five populous
      quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
      about the same time, in the last years of the reign of honorius,
      the goths, the burgundians, and the franks, obtained a permanent
      seat and dominion in the provinces of gaul. the liberal grant of
      the usurper jovinus to his burgundian allies, was confirmed by
      the lawful emperor; the lands of the first, or upper, germany,
      were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually
      occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the two provinces which
      still retain, with the titles of duchy and county, the national
      appellation of burgundy. 168 the franks, the valiant and faithful
      allies of the roman republic, were soon tempted to imitate the
      invaders, whom they had so bravely resisted. treves, the capital
      of gaul, was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble
      colony, which they so long maintained in the district of
      toxandia, in brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of
      the meuse and scheld, till their independent power filled the
      whole extent of the second, or lower germany. these facts may be
      sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation
      of the french monarchy by pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and
      even the existence, of that hero, have been justly arraigned by
      the impartial severity of modern criticism. 169

      the ruin of the opulent provinces of gaul may be dated from the
      establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous
      and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest
      or passion, to violate the public peace. a heavy and partial
      ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials, who had escaped
      the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were
      assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their
      families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling
      natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their
      fathers. yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot
      of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the romans
      themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in
      the madness of civil discord. the triumvirs proscribed eighteen
      of the most flourishing colonies of italy; and distributed their
      lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of
      caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country. two poets of
      unequal fame have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of
      their patrimony; but the legionaries of augustus appear to have
      surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded
      gaul under the reign of honorius. it was not without the utmost
      difficulty that virgil escaped from the sword of the centurion,
      who had usurped his farm in the neighborhood of mantua; 170 but
      paulinus of bourdeaux received a sum of money from his gothic
      purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and
      though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this
      act of rapine was disguised by some colors of moderation and
      equity. 171 the odious name of conquerors was softened into the
      mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the romans; and
      the barbarians of gaul, more especially the goths, repeatedly
      declared, that they were bound to the people by the ties of
      hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and
      military service. the title of honorius and his successors, their
      laws, and their civil magistrates, were still respected in the
      provinces of gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to
      the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and
      independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously
      solicited the more honorable rank of master-generals of the
      imperial armies. 172 such was the involuntary reverence which the
      roman name still impressed on the minds of those warriors, who
      had borne away in triumph the spoils of the capitol.

      whilst italy was ravaged by the goths, and a succession of feeble
      tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the alps, the british
      island separated itself from the body of the roman empire. the
      regular forces, which guarded that remote province, had been
      gradually withdrawn; and britain was abandoned without defence to
      the saxon pirates, and the savages of ireland and caledonia. the
      britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy
      and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy. they assembled in arms,
      repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of
      their own strength. 173 afflicted by similar calamities, and
      actuated by the same spirit, the armorican provinces (a name
      which comprehended the maritime countries of gaul between the
      seine and the loire 174 resolved to imitate the example of the
      neighboring island. they expelled the roman magistrates, who
      acted under the authority of the usurper constantine; and a free
      government was established among a people who had so long been
      subject to the arbitrary will of a master. the independence of
      britain and armorica was soon confirmed by honorius himself, the
      lawful emperor of the west; and the letters, by which he
      committed to the new states the care of their own safety, might
      be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the
      exercise and rights of sovereignty. this interpretation was, in
      some measure, justified by the event.

      after the usurpers of gaul had successively fallen, the maritime
      provinces were restored to the empire. yet their obedience was
      imperfect and precarious: the vain, inconstant, rebellious
      disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom
      or servitude; 175 and armorica, though it could not long maintain
      the form of a republic, 176 was agitated by frequent and
      destructive revolts. britain was irrecoverably lost. 177 but as
      the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote
      province, the separation was not imbittered by the reproach of
      tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection
      were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national
      friendship. 178

      12, p. 50, edit. smith) acknowledges that the romans finally left
      britain in the reign of honorius. yet our modern historians and
      antiquaries extend the term of their dominion; and there are some
      who allow only the interval of a few months between their
      departure and the arrival of the saxons.]

      will hereafter be produced, that the independent britons raised
      12,000 men for the service of the emperor anthemius, in gaul.]

      this revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and
      military government; and the independent country, during a period
      of forty years, till the descent of the saxons, was ruled by the
      authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns. 179
      i. zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular
      transaction, very accurately observes, that the letters of
      honorius were addressed to the cities of britain. 180 under the
      protection of the romans, ninety-two considerable towns had
      arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among
      these, thirty-three cities were distinguished above the rest by
      their superior privileges and importance. 181 each of these
      cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a
      legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic
      policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed
      among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of
      the people, according to the original model of the roman
      constitution. 182 the management of a common revenue, the
      exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of
      public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty
      republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth
      of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range
      themselves under the standard of the magistrate. but the desire
      of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burdens, of
      political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of
      discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed, that the restoration
      of british freedom was exempt from tumult and faction. the
      preeminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently
      violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles,
      who complained that they were become the subjects of their own
      servants, 183 would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary
      monarch.

      ii. the jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country, was
      supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators;
      and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land,
      consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these
      rising republics. the sphere of their attraction was proportioned
      to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but
      the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed
      by the neighborhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of
      independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and
      war. the gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation
      of italian elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles,
      the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country: 184 the
      produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to
      maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of
      licentious followers; and the chieftain might assume, within his
      own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate. several of these
      british chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings;
      and many more would be tempted to adopt this honorable genealogy,
      and to vindicate their hereditary claims, which had been
      suspended by the usurpation of the caesars. 185 their situation
      and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the
      language, and the customs of their ancestors. if the princes of
      britain relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously
      preserved the laws and manners of rome, the whole island must
      have been gradually divided by the distinction of two national
      parties; again broken into a thousand subdivisions of war and
      faction, by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
      the public strength, instead of being united against a foreign
      enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the
      personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head
      of his equals, might enable him to subdue the freedom of some
      neighboring cities; and to claim a rank among the tyrants, 186
      who infested britain after the dissolution of the roman
      government. iii. the british church might be composed of thirty
      or forty bishops, 187 with an adequate proportion of the inferior
      clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor
      188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem, by a decent
      and exemplary behavior.

      the interest, as well as the temper of the clergy, was favorable
      to the peace and union of their distracted country: those
      salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular
      discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that
      could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.

      in such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat
      promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the
      state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated;
      differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed,
      wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and
      there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a
      pendragon, or dictator, was elected by the general consent of the
      britons. these pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal
      character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition;
      and the british clergy incessantly labored to eradicate the
      pelagian heresy, which they abhorred, as the peculiar disgrace of
      their native country. 189

      it is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural,
      that the revolt of britain and armorica should have introduced an
      appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of gaul. in a
      solemn edict, 190 filled with the strongest assurances of that
      paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom
      feel, the emperor honorius promulgated his intention of convening
      an annual assembly of the seven provinces: a name peculiarly
      appropriated to aquitain and the ancient narbonnese, which had
      long since exchanged their celtic rudeness for the useful and
      elegant arts of italy. 191 arles, the seat of government and
      commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly; which
      regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of
      august to the thirteenth of september, of every year. it

      provincial governors, one consular, and six presidents; of the
      magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about sixty cities; and
      of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honorable
      and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as
      the representatives of their country. they were empowered to
      interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose
      the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the
      excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every
      subject of local or national importance, that could tend to the
      restoration of the peace and prosperity of the seven provinces.
      if such an institution, which gave the people an interest in
      their own government, had been universally established by trajan
      or the antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might
      have been cherished and propagated in the empire of rome. the
      privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the
      monarch; the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have
      been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the
      interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country
      would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of
      natives and freemen. under the mild and generous influence of
      liberty, the roman empire might have remained invincible and
      immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of
      human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital
      and constituent members might have separately preserved their
      vigor and independence. but in the decline of the empire, when
      every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy
      application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any
      important or salutary effects. the emperor honorius expresses his
      surprise, that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a
      privilege which they should ardently have solicited. a fine of
      three, or even five, pounds of gold, was imposed on the absent
      representatives; who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of
      a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their
      oppressors.

     eutropius.revolt of gainas.persecution of st. john
     chrysostom.theodosius ii. emperor of the east.his sister
     pulcheria.his wife eudocia.the persian war, and division of
     armenia.

      the division of the roman world between the sons of theodosius
      marks the final establishment of the empire of the east, which,
      from the reign of arcadius to the taking of constantinople by the
      turks, subsisted one thousand and fifty-eight years, in a state
      of premature and perpetual decay. the sovereign of that empire
      assumed, and obstinately retained, the vain, and at length
      fictitious, title of emperor of the romans; and the hereditary
      appellation of caesar and augustus continued to declare, that he
      was the legitimate successor of the first of men, who had reigned
      over the first of nations. the place of constantinople rivalled,
      and perhaps excelled, the magnificence of persia; and the
      eloquent sermons of st. chrysostom 1 celebrate, while they
      condemn, the pompous luxury of the reign of arcadius. the
      emperor, says he, wears on his head either a diadem, or a crown
      of gold, decorated with precious stones of inestimable value.
      these ornaments, and his purple garments, are reserved for his
      sacred person alone; and his robes of silk are embroidered with
      the figures of golden dragons. his throne is of massy gold.
      whenever he appears in public, he is surrounded by his courtiers,
      his guards, and his attendants. their spears, their shields,
      their cuirasses, the bridles and trappings of their horses, have
      either the substance or the appearance of gold; and the large
      splendid boss in the midst of their shield is encircled with
      smaller bosses, which represent the shape of the human eye. the
      two mules that drew the chariot of the monarch are perfectly
      white, and shining all over with gold. the chariot itself, of
      pure and solid gold, attracts the admiration of the spectators,
      who contemplate the purple curtains, the snowy carpet, the size
      of the precious stones, and the resplendent plates of gold, that
      glitter as they are agitated by the motion of the carriage. the
      imperial pictures are white, on a blue ground; the emperor
      appears seated on his throne, with his arms, his horses, and his
      guards beside him; and his vanquished enemies in chains at his
      feet. the successors of constantine established their perpetual
      residence in the royal city, which he had erected on the verge of
      europe and asia. inaccessible to the menaces of their enemies,
      and perhaps to the complaints of their people, they received,
      with each wind, the tributary productions of every climate; while
      the impregnable strength of their capital continued for ages to
      defy the hostile attempts of the barbarians. their dominions were
      bounded by the adriatic and the tigris; and the whole interval of
      twenty-five days navigation, which separated the extreme cold of
      scythia from the torrid zone of thiopia, 2 was comprehended
      within the limits of the empire of the east. the populous
      countries of that empire were the seat of art and learning, of
      luxury and wealth; and the inhabitants, who had assumed the
      language and manners of greeks, styled themselves, with some
      appearance of truth, the most enlightened and civilized portion
      of the human species. the form of government was a pure and
      simple monarchy; the name of the roman republic, which so long
      preserved a faint tradition of freedom, was confined to the latin
      provinces; and the princes of constantinople measured their
      greatness by the servile obedience of their people. they were
      ignorant how much this passive disposition enervates and degrades
      every faculty of the mind. the subjects, who had resigned their
      will to the absolute commands of a master, were equally incapable
      of guarding their lives and fortunes against the assaults of the
      barbarians, or of defending their reason from the terrors of
      superstition.

      the first events of the reign of arcadius and honorius are so
      intimately connected, that the rebellion of the goths, and the
      fall of rufinus, have already claimed a place in the history of
      the west. it has already been observed, that eutropius, 3 one of
      the principal eunuchs of the palace of constantinople, succeeded
      the haughty minister whose ruin he had accomplished, and whose
      vices he soon imitated. every order of the state bowed to the new
      favorite; and their tame and obsequious submission encouraged him
      to insult the laws, and, what is still more difficult and
      dangerous, the manners of his country. under the weakest of the
      predecessors of arcadius, the reign of the eunuchs had been
      secret and almost invisible. they insinuated themselves into the
      confidence of the prince; but their ostensible functions were
      confined to the menial service of the wardrobe and imperial
      bed-chamber. they might direct, in a whisper, the public
      counsels, and blast, by their malicious suggestions, the fame and
      fortunes of the most illustrious citizens; but they never
      presumed to stand forward in the front of empire, 4 or to profane
      the public honors of the state. eutropius was the first of his
      artificial sex, who dared to assume the character of a roman
      magistrate and general. sometimes, in the presence of the
      blushing senate, he ascended the tribunal to pronounce judgment,
      or to repeat elaborate harangues; and, sometimes, appeared on
      horseback, at the head of his troops, in the dress and armor of a
      hero. the disregard of custom and decency always betrays a weak
      and ill-regulated mind; nor does eutropius seem to have
      compensated for the folly of the design by any superior merit or
      ability in the execution. his former habits of life had not
      introduced him to the study of the laws, or the exercises of the
      field; his awkward and unsuccessful attempts provoked the secret
      contempt of the spectators; the goths expressed their wish that
      such a general might always command the armies of rome; and the
      name of the minister was branded with ridicule, more pernicious,
      perhaps, than hatred, to a public character. the subjects of
      arcadius were exasperated by the recollection, that this deformed
      and decrepit eunuch, 6 who so perversely mimicked the actions of
      a man, was born in the most abject condition of servitude; that
      before he entered the imperial palace, he had been successively
      sold and purchased by a hundred masters, who had exhausted his
      youthful strength in every mean and infamous office, and at
      length dismissed him, in his old age, to freedom and poverty. 7
      while these disgraceful stories were circulated, and perhaps
      exaggerated, in private conversation, the vanity of the favorite
      was flattered with the most extraordinary honors. in the senate,
      in the capital, in the provinces, the statues of eutropius were
      erected, in brass, or marble, decorated with the symbols of his
      civil and military virtues, and inscribed with the pompous title
      of the third founder of constantinople. he was promoted to the
      rank of patrician, which began to signify in a popular, and even
      legal, acceptation, the father of the emperor; and the last year
      of the fourth century was polluted by the consulship of a eunuch
      and a slave. this strange and inexpiable prodigy 8 awakened,
      however, the prejudices of the romans. the effeminate consul was
      rejected by the west, as an indelible stain to the annals of the
      republic; and without invoking the shades of brutus and camillus,
      the colleague of eutropius, a learned and respectable magistrate,
      9 sufficiently represented the different maxims of the two
      administrations.

      227.) they are indeed a very elegant and spirited satire; and

      were less vague and more temperate.]

      and wrinkled than that of an old woman. claudian remarks, (i.

      gave him to the old general arintheus, for whom he very skilfully
      exercised the profession of a pimp. 3. he was given, on her
      marriage, to the daughter of arintheus; and the future consul was

      the bold and vigorous mind of rufinus seems to have been actuated
      by a more sanguinary and revengeful spirit; but the avarice of
      the eunuch was not less insatiate than that of the prfect. 10
      as long as he despoiled the oppressors, who had enriched
      themselves with the plunder of the people, eutropius might
      gratify his covetous disposition without much envy or injustice:
      but the progress of his rapine soon invaded the wealth which had
      been acquired by lawful inheritance, or laudable industry. the
      usual methods of extortion were practised and improved; and
      claudian has sketched a lively and original picture of the public
      auction of the state. the impotence of the eunuch, says that
      agreeable satirist, has served only to stimulate his avarice:
      the same hand which in his servile condition, was exercised in
      petty thefts, to unlock the coffers of his master, now grasps the
      riches of the world; and this infamous broker of the empire
      appreciates and divides the roman provinces from mount haemus to
      the tigris. one man, at the expense of his villa, is made
      proconsul of asia; a second purchases syria with his wifes
      jewels; and a third laments that he has exchanged his paternal
      estate for the government of bithynia. in the antechamber of
      eutropius, a large tablet is exposed to public view, which marks
      the respective prices of the provinces. the different value of
      pontus, of galatia, of lydia, is accurately distinguished. lycia
      may be obtained for so many thousand pieces of gold; but the
      opulence of phrygia will require a more considerable sum. the
      eunuch wishes to obliterate, by the general disgrace, his
      personal ignominy; and as he has been sold himself, he is
      desirous of selling the rest of mankind. in the eager contention,
      the balance, which contains the fate and fortunes of the
      province, often trembles on the beam; and till one of the scales
      is inclined, by a superior weight, the mind of the impartial
      judge remains in anxious suspense. such, continues the indignant
      poet, are the fruits of roman valor, of the defeat of antiochus,
      and of the triumph of pompey. this venal prostitution of public
      honors secured the impunity of future crimes; but the riches,
      which eutropius derived from confiscation, were already stained
      with injustice; since it was decent to accuse, and to condemn,
      the proprietors of the wealth, which he was impatient to
      confiscate. some noble blood was shed by the hand of the
      executioner; and the most inhospitable extremities of the empire
      were filled with innocent and illustrious exiles. among the
      generals and consuls of the east, abundantius 12 had reason to
      dread the first effects of the resentment of eutropius. he had
      been guilty of the unpardonable crime of introducing that abject
      slave to the palace of constantinople; and some degree of praise
      must be allowed to a powerful and ungrateful favorite, who was
      satisfied with the disgrace of his benefactor. abundantius was
      stripped of his ample fortunes by an imperial rescript, and
      banished to pityus, on the euxine, the last frontier of the roman
      world; where he subsisted by the precarious mercy of the
      barbarians, till he could obtain, after the fall of eutropius, a
      milder exile at sidon, in phoenicia. the destruction of timasius
      13 required a more serious and regular mode of attack. that great
      officer, the master-general of the armies of theodosius, had
      signalized his valor by a decisive victory, which he obtained
      over the goths of thessaly; but he was too prone, after the
      example of his sovereign, to enjoy the luxury of peace, and to
      abandon his confidence to wicked and designing flatterers.
      timasius had despised the public clamor, by promoting an infamous
      dependant to the command of a cohort; and he deserved to feel the
      ingratitude of bargus, who was secretly instigated by the
      favorite to accuse his patron of a treasonable conspiracy. the
      general was arraigned before the tribunal of arcadius himself;
      and the principal eunuch stood by the side of the throne to
      suggest the questions and answers of his sovereign. but as this
      form of trial might be deemed partial and arbitrary, the further
      inquiry into the crimes of timasius was delegated to saturninus
      and procopius; the former of consular rank, the latter still
      respected as the father-in-law of the emperor valens. the
      appearances of a fair and legal proceeding were maintained by the
      blunt honesty of procopius; and he yielded with reluctance to the
      obsequious dexterity of his colleague, who pronounced a sentence
      of condemnation against the unfortunate timasius. his immense
      riches were confiscated in the name of the emperor, and for the
      benefit of the favorite; and he was doomed to perpetual exile a
      oasis, a solitary spot in the midst of the sandy deserts of
      libya. 14 secluded from all human converse, the master-general of
      the roman armies was lost forever to the world; but the
      circumstances of his fate have been related in a various and
      contradictory manner. it is insinuated that eutropius despatched
      a private order for his secret execution. 15 it was reported,
      that, in attempting to escape from oasis, he perished in the
      desert, of thirst and hunger; and that his dead body was found on
      the sands of libya. 16 it has been asserted, with more
      confidence, that his son syagrius, after successfully eluding the
      pursuit of the agents and emissaries of the court, collected a
      band of african robbers; that he rescued timasius from the place
      of his exile; and that both the father and the son disappeared
      from the knowledge of mankind. 17 but the ungrateful bargus,
      instead of being suffered to possess the reward of guilt was soon
      after circumvented and destroyed, by the more powerful villany of
      the minister himself, who retained sense and spirit enough to
      abhor the instrument of his own crimes.

      this rumor was spread by the friends of eutropius.]

      the public hatred, and the despair of individuals, continually
      threatened, or seemed to threaten, the personal safety of
      eutropius; as well as of the numerous adherents, who were
      attached to his fortune, and had been promoted by his venal
      favor. for their mutual defence, he contrived the safeguard of a
      law, which violated every principal of humanity and justice. 18
      i. it is enacted, in the name, and by the authority of arcadius,
      that all those who should conspire, either with subjects or with
      strangers, against the lives of any of the persons whom the
      emperor considers as the members of his own body, shall be
      punished with death and confiscation. this species of fictitious
      and metaphorical treason is extended to protect, not only the
      illustrious officers of the state and army, who were admitted
      into the sacred consistory, but likewise the principal domestics
      of the palace, the senators of constantinople, the military
      commanders, and the civil magistrates of the provinces; a vague
      and indefinite list, which, under the successors of constantine,
      included an obscure and numerous train of subordinate ministers.
      ii. this extreme severity might perhaps be justified, had it been
      only directed to secure the representatives of the sovereign from
      any actual violence in the execution of their office. but the
      whole body of imperial dependants claimed a privilege, or rather
      impunity, which screened them, in the loosest moments of their
      lives, from the hasty, perhaps the justifiable, resentment of
      their fellow-citizens; and, by a strange perversion of the laws,
      the same degree of guilt and punishment was applied to a private
      quarrel, and to a deliberate conspiracy against the emperor and
      the empire. the edicts of arcadius most positively and most
      absurdly declares, that in such cases of treason, thoughts and
      actions ought to be punished with equal severity; that the
      knowledge of a mischievous intention, unless it be instantly
      revealed, becomes equally criminal with the intention itself; 19
      and that those rash men, who shall presume to solicit the pardon
      of traitors, shall themselves be branded with public and
      perpetual infamy. iii. with regard to the sons of the traitors,
      (continues the emperor,) although they ought to share the
      punishment, since they will probably imitate the guilt, of their
      parents, yet, by the special effect of our imperial lenity, we
      grant them their lives; but, at the same time, we declare them
      incapable of inheriting, either on the fathers or on the
      mothers side, or of receiving any gift or legacy, from the
      testament either of kinsmen or of strangers. stigmatized with
      hereditary infamy, excluded from the hopes of honors or fortune,
      let them endure the pangs of poverty and contempt, till they
      shall consider life as a calamity, and death as a comfort and
      relief. in such words, so well adapted to insult the feelings of
      mankind, did the emperor, or rather his favorite eunuch, applaud
      the moderation of a law, which transferred the same unjust and
      inhuman penalties to the children of all those who had seconded,
      or who had not disclosed, their fictitious conspiracies. some of
      the noblest regulations of roman jurisprudence have been suffered
      to expire; but this edict, a convenient and forcible engine of
      ministerial tyranny, was carefully inserted in the codes of
      theodosius and justinian; and the same maxims have been revived
      in modern ages, to protect the electors of germany, and the
      cardinals of the church of rome. 20

      yet these sanguinary laws, which spread terror among a disarmed
      and dispirited people, were of too weak a texture to restrain the
      bold enterprise of tribigild 21 the ostrogoth. the colony of that
      warlike nation, which had been planted by theodosius in one of
      the most fertile districts of phrygia, 22 impatiently compared
      the slow returns of laborious husbandry with the successful
      rapine and liberal rewards of alaric; and their leader resented,
      as a personal affront, his own ungracious reception in the palace
      of constantinople. a soft and wealthy province, in the heart of
      the empire, was astonished by the sound of war; and the faithful
      vassal who had been disregarded or oppressed, was again
      respected, as soon as he resumed the hostile character of a
      barbarian. the vineyards and fruitful fields, between the rapid
      marsyas and the winding maeander, 23 were consumed with fire; the
      decayed walls of the cities crumbled into dust, at the first
      stroke of an enemy; the trembling inhabitants escaped from a
      bloody massacre to the shores of the hellespont; and a
      considerable part of asia minor was desolated by the rebellion of
      tribigild. his rapid progress was checked by the resistance of
      the peasants of pamphylia; and the ostrogoths, attacked in a
      narrow pass, between the city of selgae, 24 a deep morass, and
      the craggy cliffs of mount taurus, were defeated with the loss of
      their bravest troops. but the spirit of their chief was not
      daunted by misfortune; and his army was continually recruited by
      swarms of barbarians and outlaws, who were desirous of exercising
      the profession of robbery, under the more honorable names of war
      and conquest. the rumors of the success of tribigild might for
      some time be suppressed by fear, or disguised by flattery; yet
      they gradually alarmed both the court and the capital. every
      misfortune was exaggerated in dark and doubtful hints; and the
      future designs of the rebels became the subject of anxious
      conjecture. whenever tribigild advanced into the inland country,
      the romans were inclined to suppose that he meditated the passage
      of mount taurus, and the invasion of syria. if he descended
      towards the sea, they imputed, and perhaps suggested, to the
      gothic chief, the more dangerous project of arming a fleet in the
      harbors of ionia, and of extending his depredations along the
      maritime coast, from the mouth of the nile to the port of
      constantinople. the approach of danger, and the obstinacy of
      tribigild, who refused all terms of accommodation, compelled
      eutropius to summon a council of war. 25 after claiming for
      himself the privilege of a veteran soldier, the eunuch intrusted
      the guard of thrace and the hellespont to gainas the goth, and
      the command of the asiatic army to his favorite, leo; two
      generals, who differently, but effectually, promoted the cause of
      the rebels. leo, 26 who, from the bulk of his body, and the
      dulness of his mind, was surnamed the ajax of the east, had
      deserted his original trade of a woolcomber, to exercise, with
      much less skill and success, the military profession; and his
      uncertain operations were capriciously framed and executed, with
      an ignorance of real difficulties, and a timorous neglect of
      every favorable opportunity. the rashness of the ostrogoths had
      drawn them into a disadvantageous position between the rivers
      melas and eurymedon, where they were almost besieged by the
      peasants of pamphylia; but the arrival of an imperial army,
      instead of completing their destruction, afforded the means of
      safety and victory. tribigild surprised the unguarded camp of the
      romans, in the darkness of the night; seduced the faith of the
      greater part of the barbarian auxiliaries, and dissipated,
      without much effort, the troops, which had been corrupted by the
      relaxation of discipline, and the luxury of the capital. the
      discontent of gainas, who had so boldly contrived and executed
      the death of rufinus, was irritated by the fortune of his
      unworthy successor; he accused his own dishonorable patience
      under the servile reign of a eunuch; and the ambitious goth was
      convicted, at least in the public opinion, of secretly fomenting
      the revolt of tribigild, with whom he was connected by a
      domestic, as well as by a national alliance. 27 when gainas
      passed the hellespont, to unite under his standard the remains of
      the asiatic troops, he skilfully adapted his motions to the
      wishes of the ostrogoths; abandoning, by his retreat, the country
      which they desired to invade; or facilitating, by his approach,
      the desertion of the barbarian auxiliaries. to the imperial court
      he repeatedly magnified the valor, the genius, the inexhaustible
      resources of tribigild; confessed his own inability to prosecute
      the war; and extorted the permission of negotiating with his
      invincible adversary. the conditions of peace were dictated by
      the haughty rebel; and the peremptory demand of the head of
      eutropius revealed the author and the design of this hostile
      conspiracy.

      chapter xxxii: emperors arcadius, eutropius, theodosius ii.part
      ii.

      the bold satirist, who has indulged his discontent by the partial
      and passionate censure of the christian emperors, violates the
      dignity, rather than the truth, of history, by comparing the son
      of theodosius to one of those harmless and simple animals, who
      scarcely feel that they are the property of their shepherd. two
      passions, however, fear and conjugal affection, awakened the
      languid soul of arcadius: he was terrified by the threats of a
      victorious barbarian; and he yielded to the tender eloquence of
      his wife eudoxia, who, with a flood of artificial tears,
      presenting her infant children to their father, implored his
      justice for some real or imaginary insult, which she imputed to
      the audacious eunuch. 28 the emperors hand was directed to sign
      the condemnation of eutropius; the magic spell, which during four
      years had bound the prince and the people, was instantly
      dissolved; and the acclamations that so lately hailed the merit
      and fortune of the favorite, were converted into the clamors of
      the soldiers and people, who reproached his crimes, and pressed
      his immediate execution. in this hour of distress and despair,
      his only refuge was in the sanctuary of the church, whose
      privileges he had wisely or profanely attempted to circumscribe;
      and the most eloquent of the saints, john chrysostom, enjoyed the
      triumph of protecting a prostrate minister, whose choice had
      raised him to the ecclesiastical throne of constantinople. the
      archbishop, ascending the pulpit of the cathedral, that he might
      be distinctly seen and heard by an innumerable crowd of either
      sex and of every age, pronounced a seasonable and pathetic
      discourse on the forgiveness of injuries, and the instability of
      human greatness. the agonies of the pale and affrighted wretch,
      who lay grovelling under the table of the altar, exhibited a
      solemn and instructive spectacle; and the orator, who was
      afterwards accused of insulting the misfortunes of eutropius,
      labored to excite the contempt, that he might assuage the fury,
      of the people. 29 the powers of humanity, of superstition, and of
      eloquence, prevailed. the empress eudoxia was restrained by her
      own prejudices, or by those of her subjects, from violating the
      sanctuary of the church; and eutropius was tempted to capitulate,
      by the milder arts of persuasion, and by an oath, that his life
      should be spared. 30 careless of the dignity of their sovereign,
      the new ministers of the palace immediately published an edict to
      declare, that his late favorite had disgraced the names of consul
      and patrician, to abolish his statues, to confiscate his wealth,
      and to inflict a perpetual exile in the island of cyprus. 31 a
      despicable and decrepit eunuch could no longer alarm the fears of
      his enemies; nor was he capable of enjoying what yet remained,
      the comforts of peace, of solitude, and of a happy climate. but
      their implacable revenge still envied him the last moments of a
      miserable life, and eutropius had no sooner touched the shores of
      cyprus, than he was hastily recalled. the vain hope of eluding,
      by a change of place, the obligation of an oath, engaged the
      empress to transfer the scene of his trial and execution from
      constantinople to the adjacent suburb of chalcedon. the consul
      aurelian pronounced the sentence; and the motives of that
      sentence expose the jurisprudence of a despotic government. the
      crimes which eutropius had committed against the people might
      have justified his death; but he was found guilty of harnessing
      to his chariot the sacred animals, who, from their breed or
      color, were reserved for the use of the emperor alone. 32

      while this domestic revolution was transacted, gainas 33 openly
      revolted from his allegiance; united his forces at thyatira in
      lydia, with those of tribigild; and still maintained his superior
      ascendant over the rebellious leader of the ostrogoths. the
      confederate armies advanced, without resistance, to the straits
      of the hellespont and the bosphorus; and arcadius was instructed
      to prevent the loss of his asiatic dominions, by resigning his
      authority and his person to the faith of the barbarians. the
      church of the holy martyr euphemia, situate on a lofty eminence
      near chalcedon, 34 was chosen for the place of the interview.
      gainas bowed with reverence at the feet of the emperor, whilst he
      required the sacrifice of aurelian and saturninus, two ministers
      of consular rank; and their naked necks were exposed, by the
      haughty rebel, to the edge of the sword, till he condescended to
      grant them a precarious and disgraceful respite. the goths,
      according to the terms of the agreement, were immediately
      transported from asia into europe; and their victorious chief,
      who accepted the title of master-general of the roman armies,
      soon filled constantinople with his troops, and distributed among
      his dependants the honors and rewards of the empire. in his early
      youth, gainas had passed the danube as a suppliant and a
      fugitive: his elevation had been the work of valor and fortune;
      and his indiscreet or perfidious conduct was the cause of his
      rapid downfall. notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of the
      archbishop, he importunately claimed for his arian sectaries the
      possession of a peculiar church; and the pride of the catholics
      was offended by the public toleration of heresy. 35 every quarter
      of constantinople was filled with tumult and disorder; and the
      barbarians gazed with such ardor on the rich shops of the
      jewellers, and the tables of the bankers, which were covered with
      gold and silver, that it was judged prudent to remove those
      dangerous temptations from their sight. they resented the
      injurious precaution; and some alarming attempts were made,
      during the night, to attack and destroy with fire the imperial
      palace. 36 in this state of mutual and suspicious hostility, the
      guards and the people of constantinople shut the gates, and rose
      in arms to prevent or to punish the conspiracy of the goths.
      during the absence of gainas, his troops were surprised and
      oppressed; seven thousand barbarians perished in this bloody
      massacre. in the fury of the pursuit, the catholics uncovered the
      roof, and continued to throw down flaming logs of wood, till they
      overwhelmed their adversaries, who had retreated to the church or
      conventicle of the arians. gainas was either innocent of the
      design, or too confident of his success; he was astonished by the
      intelligence that the flower of his army had been ingloriously
      destroyed; that he himself was declared a public enemy; and that
      his countryman, fravitta, a brave and loyal confederate, had
      assumed the management of the war by sea and land. the
      enterprises of the rebel, against the cities of thrace, were
      encountered by a firm and well-ordered defence; his hungry
      soldiers were soon reduced to the grass that grew on the margin
      of the fortifications; and gainas, who vainly regretted the
      wealth and luxury of asia, embraced a desperate resolution of
      forcing the passage of the hellespont. he was destitute of
      vessels; but the woods of the chersonesus afforded materials for
      rafts, and his intrepid barbarians did not refuse to trust
      themselves to the waves. but fravitta attentively watched the
      progress of their undertaking. as soon as they had gained the
      middle of the stream, the roman galleys, 37 impelled by the full
      force of oars, of the current, and of a favorable wind, rushed
      forwards in compact order, and with irresistible weight; and the
      hellespont was covered with the fragments of the gothic
      shipwreck. after the destruction of his hopes, and the loss of
      many thousands of his bravest soldiers, gainas, who could no
      longer aspire to govern or to subdue the romans, determined to
      resume the independence of a savage life. a light and active body
      of barbarian horse, disengaged from their infantry and baggage,
      might perform in eight or ten days a march of three hundred miles
      from the hellespont to the danube; 38 the garrisons of that
      important frontier had been gradually annihilated; the river, in
      the month of december, would be deeply frozen; and the unbounded
      prospect of scythia was opened to the ambition of gainas. this
      design was secretly communicated to the national troops, who
      devoted themselves to the fortunes of their leader; and before
      the signal of departure was given, a great number of provincial
      auxiliaries, whom he suspected of an attachment to their native
      country, were perfidiously massacred. the goths advanced, by
      rapid marches, through the plains of thrace; and they were soon
      delivered from the fear of a pursuit, by the vanity of fravitta,
      3811 who, instead of extinguishing the war, hastened to enjoy the
      popular applause, and to assume the peaceful honors of the
      consulship. but a formidable ally appeared in arms to vindicate
      the majesty of the empire, and to guard the peace and liberty of
      scythia. 39 the superior forces of uldin, king of the huns,
      opposed the progress of gainas; a hostile and ruined country
      prohibited his retreat; he disdained to capitulate; and after
      repeatedly attempting to cut his way through the ranks of the
      enemy, he was slain, with his desperate followers, in the field
      of battle. eleven days after the naval victory of the hellespont,
      the head of gainas, the inestimable gift of the conqueror, was

      gratitude; and the public deliverance was celebrated by festivals
      and illuminations. the triumphs of arcadius became the subject of
      epic poems; 40 and the monarch, no longer oppressed by any
      hostile terrors, resigned himself to the mild and absolute
      dominion of his wife, the fair and artful eudoxia, who was
      sullied her fame by the persecution of st. john chrysostom.

      after the death of the indolent nectarius, the successor of
      gregory nazianzen, the church of constantinople was distracted by
      the ambition of rival candidates, who were not ashamed to
      solicit, with gold or flattery, the suffrage of the people, or of
      the favorite. on this occasion eutropius seems to have deviated
      from his ordinary maxims; and his uncorrupted judgment was
      determined only by the superior merit of a stranger. in a late
      journey into the east, he had admired the sermons of john, a
      native and presbyter of antioch, whose name has been
      distinguished by the epithet of chrysostom, or the golden mouth.
      41 a private order was despatched to the governor of syria; and
      as the people might be unwilling to resign their favorite
      preacher, he was transported, with speed and secrecy in a
      post-chariot, from antioch to constantinople. the unanimous and
      unsolicited consent of the court, the clergy, and the people,
      ratified the choice of the minister; and, both as a saint and as
      an orator, the new archbishop surpassed the sanguine expectations
      of the public. born of a noble and opulent family, in the capital
      of syria, chrysostom had been educated, by the care of a tender
      mother, under the tuition of the most skilful masters. he studied
      the art of rhetoric in the school of libanius; and that
      celebrated sophist, who soon discovered the talents of his
      disciple, ingenuously confessed that john would have deserved to
      succeed him, had he not been stolen away by the christians. his
      piety soon disposed him to receive the sacrament of baptism; to
      renounce the lucrative and honorable profession of the law; and
      to bury himself in the adjacent desert, where he subdued the
      lusts of the flesh by an austere penance of six years. his
      infirmities compelled him to return to the society of mankind;
      and the authority of meletius devoted his talents to the service
      of the church: but in the midst of his family, and afterwards on
      the archiepiscopal throne, chrysostom still persevered in the
      practice of the monastic virtues. the ample revenues, which his
      predecessors had consumed in pomp and luxury, he diligently
      applied to the establishment of hospitals; and the multitudes,
      who were supported by his charity, preferred the eloquent and
      edifying discourses of their archbishop to the amusements of the
      theatre or the circus. the monuments of that eloquence, which was
      admired near twenty years at antioch and constantinople, have
      been carefully preserved; and the possession of near one thousand
      sermons, or homilies has authorized the critics 42 of succeeding
      times to appreciate the genuine merit of chrysostom. they
      unanimously attribute to the christian orator the free command of
      an elegant and copious language; the judgment to conceal the
      advantages which he derived from the knowledge of rhetoric and
      philosophy; an inexhaustible fund of metaphors and similitudes of
      ideas and images, to vary and illustrate the most familiar
      topics; the happy art of engaging the passions in the service of
      virtue; and of exposing the folly, as well as the turpitude, of
      vice, almost with the truth and spirit of a dramatic
      representation.

      zealous partisan, palladius, bishop of helenopolis, (tillemont,

      of chrysostom. tom. xiii. p. 1-90, edit. montfaucon. 2. the
      moderate erasmus, (tom. iii. epist. mcl. p. 1331-1347, edit.
      lugd. bat.) his vivacity and good sense were his own; his errors,
      in the uncultivated state of ecclesiastical antiquity, were
      almost inevitable. 3. the learned tillemont, (mem.
      ecclesiastiques, tom. xi. p. 1-405, 547-626, &c. &c.,) who
      compiles the lives of the saints with incredible patience and
      religious accuracy. he has minutely searched the voluminous works
      of chrysostom himself. 4. father montfaucon, who has perused
      those works with the curious diligence of an editor, discovered
      several new homilies, and again reviewed and composed the life of
      chrysostom, (opera chrysostom. tom. xiii. p. 91-177.)]

      of chrysostom, i have given my confidence to the two most

      iii. p. 38:) yet the good taste of the former is sometimes
      vitiated by an excessive love of antiquity; and the good sense of
      the latter is always restrained by prudential considerations.]

      the pastoral labors of the archbishop of constantinople provoked,
      and gradually united against him, two sorts of enemies; the
      aspiring clergy, who envied his success, and the obstinate
      sinners, who were offended by his reproofs. when chrysostom
      thundered, from the pulpit of st. sophia, against the degeneracy
      of the christians, his shafts were spent among the crowd, without
      wounding, or even marking, the character of any individual. when
      he declaimed against the peculiar vices of the rich, poverty
      might obtain a transient consolation from his invectives; but the
      guilty were still sheltered by their numbers; and the reproach
      itself was dignified by some ideas of superiority and enjoyment.
      but as the pyramid rose towards the summit, it insensibly
      diminished to a point; and the magistrates, the ministers, the
      favorite eunuchs, the ladies of the court, 43 the empress eudoxia
      herself, had a much larger share of guilt to divide among a
      smaller proportion of criminals. the personal applications of the
      audience were anticipated, or confirmed, by the testimony of
      their own conscience; and the intrepid preacher assumed the
      dangerous right of exposing both the offence and the offender to
      the public abhorrence. the secret resentment of the court
      encouraged the discontent of the clergy and monks of
      constantinople, who were too hastily reformed by the fervent zeal
      of their archbishop. he had condemned, from the pulpit, the
      domestic females of the clergy of constantinople, who, under the
      name of servants, or sisters, afforded a perpetual occasion
      either of sin or of scandal. the silent and solitary ascetics,
      who had secluded themselves from the world, were entitled to the
      warmest approbation of chrysostom; but he despised and
      stigmatized, as the disgrace of their holy profession, the crowd
      of degenerate monks, who, from some unworthy motives of pleasure
      or profit, so frequently infested the streets of the capital. to
      the voice of persuasion, the archbishop was obliged to add the
      terrors of authority; and his ardor, in the exercise of
      ecclesiastical jurisdiction, was not always exempt from passion;
      nor was it always guided by prudence. chrysostom was naturally of
      a choleric disposition. 44 although he struggled, according to
      the precepts of the gospel, to love his private enemies, he
      indulged himself in the privilege of hating the enemies of god
      and of the church; and his sentiments were sometimes delivered
      with too much energy of countenance and expression. he still
      maintained, from some considerations of health or abstinence, his
      former habits of taking his repasts alone; and this inhospitable
      custom, 45 which his enemies imputed to pride, contributed, at
      least, to nourish the infirmity of a morose and unsocial humor.
      separated from that familiar intercourse, which facilitates the
      knowledge and the despatch of business, he reposed an
      unsuspecting confidence in his deacon serapion; and seldom
      applied his speculative knowledge of human nature to the
      particular character, either of his dependants, or of his equals.

      conscious of the purity of his intentions, and perhaps of the
      superiority of his genius, the archbishop of constantinople
      extended the jurisdiction of the imperial city, that he might
      enlarge the sphere of his pastoral labors; and the conduct which
      the profane imputed to an ambitious motive, appeared to
      chrysostom himself in the light of a sacred and indispensable
      duty. in his visitation through the asiatic provinces, he deposed
      thirteen bishops of lydia and phrygia; and indiscreetly declared
      that a deep corruption of simony and licentiousness had infected
      the whole episcopal order. 46 if those bishops were innocent,
      such a rash and unjust condemnation must excite a well-grounded
      discontent. if they were guilty, the numerous associates of their
      guilt would soon discover that their own safety depended on the
      ruin of the archbishop; whom they studied to represent as the
      tyrant of the eastern church.

      43 (return) [ the females of constantinople distinguished

      three noble and opulent widows, marsa, castricia, and eugraphia,
      were the leaders of the persecution, (pallad. dialog. tom. xiii.
      p. 14.) it was impossible that they should forgive a preacher who
      reproached their affectation to conceal, by the ornaments of
      dress, their age and ugliness, (pallad p. 27.) olympias, by equal
      zeal, displayed in a more pious cause, has obtained the title of

      had conversed with many persons intimately acquainted with the
      virtues and imperfections of the saint.]

      or devotion, often kept him fasting till sunset. 4. he detested
      the noise and levity of great dinners. 5. he saved the expense

      iii in act. apostol. p. 29) that the number of bishops, who might
      be saved, bore a very small proportion to those who would be
      damned.]

      this ecclesiastical conspiracy was managed by theophilus, 47
      archbishop of alexandria, an active and ambitious prelate, who
      displayed the fruits of rapine in monuments of ostentation. his
      national dislike to the rising greatness of a city which degraded
      him from the second to the third rank in the christian world, was
      exasperated by some personal dispute with chrysostom himself. 48
      by the private invitation of the empress, theophilus landed at
      constantinople with a stou body of egyptian mariners, to
      encounter the populace; and a train of dependent bishops, to
      secure, by their voices, the majority of a synod. the synod 49
      was convened in the suburb of chalcedon, surnamed the oak, where
      rufinus had erected a stately church and monastery; and their
      proceedings were continued during fourteen days, or sessions. a
      bishop and a deacon accused the archbishop of constantinople; but
      the frivolous or improbable nature of the forty-seven articles
      which they presented against him, may justly be considered as a
      fair and unexceptional panegyric. four successive summons were
      signified to chrysostom; but he still refused to trust either his
      person or his reputation in the hands of his implacable enemies,
      who, prudently declining the examination of any particular
      charges, condemned his contumacious disobedience, and hastily
      pronounced a sentence of deposition. the synod of the oak
      immediately addressed the emperor to ratify and execute their
      judgment, and charitably insinuated, that the penalties of
      treason might be inflicted on the audacious preacher, who had
      reviled, under the name of jezebel, the empress eudoxia herself.
      the archbishop was rudely arrested, and conducted through the
      city, by one of the imperial messengers, who landed him, after a
      short navigation, near the entrance of the euxine; from whence,
      before the expiration of two days, he was gloriously recalled.

      the first astonishment of his faithful people had been mute and
      passive: they suddenly rose with unanimous and irresistible fury.
      theophilus escaped, but the promiscuous crowd of monks and
      egyptian mariners was slaughtered without pity in the streets of
      constantinople. 50 a seasonable earthquake justified the
      interposition of heaven; the torrent of sedition rolled forwards
      to the gates of the palace; and the empress, agitated by fear or
      remorse, threw herself at the feet of arcadius, and confessed
      that the public safety could be purchased only by the restoration
      of chrysostom. the bosphorus was covered with innumerable
      vessels; the shores of europe and asia were profusely
      illuminated; and the acclamations of a victorious people
      accompanied, from the port to the cathedral, the triumph of the
      archbishop; who, too easily, consented to resume the exercise of
      his functions, before his sentence had been legally reversed by
      the authority of an ecclesiastical synod. ignorant, or careless,
      of the impending danger, chrysostom indulged his zeal, or perhaps
      his resentment; declaimed with peculiar asperity against female
      vices; and condemned the profane honors which were addressed,
      almost in the precincts of st. sophia, to the statue of the
      empress. his imprudence tempted his enemies to inflame the
      haughty spirit of eudoxia, by reporting, or perhaps inventing,
      the famous exordium of a sermon, herodias is again furious;
      herodias again dances; she once more requires the head of john;
      an insolent allusion, which, as a woman and a sovereign, it was
      impossible for her to forgive. 51 the short interval of a
      perfidious truce was employed to concert more effectual measures
      for the disgrace and ruin of the archbishop. a numerous council
      of the eastern prelates, who were guided from a distance by the
      advice of theophilus, confirmed the validity, without examining
      the justice, of the former sentence; and a detachment of
      barbarian troops was introduced into the city, to suppress the
      emotions of the people. on the vigil of easter, the solemn
      administration of baptism was rudely interrupted by the soldiers,
      who alarmed the modesty of the naked catechumens, and violated,
      by their presence, the awful mysteries of the christian worship.
      arsacius occupied the church of st. sophia, and the
      archiepiscopal throne. the catholics retreated to the baths of
      constantine, and afterwards to the fields; where they were still
      pursued and insulted by the guards, the bishops, and the
      magistrates. the fatal day of the second and final exile of
      chrysostom was marked by the conflagration of the cathedral, of
      the senate-house, and of the adjacent buildings; and this
      calamity was imputed, without proof, but not without probability,
      to the despair of a persecuted faction. 52

      cicero might claim some merit, if his voluntary banishment
      preserved the peace of the republic; 53 but the submission of
      chrysostom was the indispensable duty of a christian and a
      subject. instead of listening to his humble prayer, that he might
      be permitted to reside at cyzicus, or nicomedia, the inflexible
      empress assigned for his exile the remote and desolate town of
      cucusus, among the ridges of mount taurus, in the lesser armenia.
      a secret hope was entertained, that the archbishop might perish
      in a difficult and dangerous march of seventy days, in the heat
      of summer, through the provinces of asia minor, where he was
      continually threatened by the hostile attacks of the isaurians,
      and the more implacable fury of the monks. yet chrysostom arrived
      in safety at the place of his confinement; and the three years
      which he spent at cucusus, and the neighboring town of arabissus,
      were the last and most glorious of his life. his character was
      consecrated by absence and persecution; the faults of his
      administration were no longer remembered; but every tongue
      repeated the praises of his genius and virtue: and the respectful
      attention of the christian world was fixed on a desert spot among
      the mountains of taurus. from that solitude the archbishop, whose
      active mind was invigorated by misfortunes, maintained a strict
      and frequent correspondence 54 with the most distant provinces;
      exhorted the separate congregation of his faithful adherents to
      persevere in their allegiance; urged the destruction of the
      temples of phoenicia, and the extirpation of heresy in the isle
      of cyprus; extended his pastoral care to the missions of persia
      and scythia; negotiated, by his ambassadors, with the roman
      pontiff and the emperor honorius; and boldly appealed, from a
      partial synod, to the supreme tribunal of a free and general
      council. the mind of the illustrious exile was still independent;
      but his captive body was exposed to the revenge of the
      oppressors, who continued to abuse the name and authority of
      arcadius. 55 an order was despatched for the instant removal of
      chrysostom to the extreme desert of pityus: and his guards so
      faithfully obeyed their cruel instructions, that, before he
      reached the sea-coast of the euxine, he expired at comana, in
      pontus, in the sixtieth year of his age. the succeeding
      generation acknowledged his innocence and merit. the archbishops
      of the east, who might blush that their predecessors had been the
      enemies of chrysostom, were gradually disposed, by the firmness

      transported from their obscure sepulchre to the royal city. 57
      the emperor theodosius advanced to receive them as far as
      chalcedon; and, falling prostrate on the coffin, implored, in the
      name of his guilty parents, arcadius and eudoxia, the forgiveness
      of the injured saint. 58

      yet a reasonable doubt may be entertained, whether any stain of
      hereditary guilt could be derived from arcadius to his successor.
      eudoxia was a young and beautiful woman, who indulged her
      passions, and despised her husband; count john enjoyed, at least,
      the familiar confidence of the empress; and the public named him
      as the real father of theodosius the younger. 59 the birth of a
      son was accepted, however, by the pious husband, as an event the
      most fortunate and honorable to himself, to his family, and to
      the eastern world: and the royal infant, by an unprecedented
      favor, was invested with the titles of caesar and augustus. in
      less than four years afterwards, eudoxia, in the bloom of youth,
      was destroyed by the consequences of a miscarriage; and this
      untimely death confounded the prophecy of a holy bishop, 60 who,
      amidst the universal joy, had ventured to foretell, that she
      should behold the long and auspicious reign of her glorious son.
      the catholics applauded the justice of heaven, which avenged the
      persecution of st. chrysostom; and perhaps the emperor was the
      only person who sincerely bewailed the loss of the haughty and
      rapacious eudoxia. such a domestic misfortune afflicted him more
      deeply than the public calamities of the east; 61 the licentious
      excursions, from pontus to palestine, of the isaurian robbers,
      whose impunity accused the weakness of the government; and the
      earthquakes, the conflagrations, the famine, and the flights of
      locusts, 62 which the popular discontent was equally disposed to
      attribute to the incapacity of the monarch. at length, in the
      thirty-first year of his age, after a reign (if we may abuse that
      word) of thirteen years, three months, and fifteen days, arcadius
      expired in the palace of constantinople. it is impossible to
      delineate his character; since, in a period very copiously
      furnished with historical materials, it has not been possible to
      remark one action that properly belongs to the son of the great
      theodosius.

      the historian procopius 63 has indeed illuminated the mind of the
      dying emperor with a ray of human prudence, or celestial wisdom.
      arcadius considered, with anxious foresight, the helpless
      condition of his son theodosius, who was no more than seven years
      of age, the dangerous factions of a minority, and the aspiring
      spirit of jezdegerd, the persian monarch. instead of tempting the
      allegiance of an ambitious subject, by the participation of
      supreme power, he boldly appealed to the magnanimity of a king;
      and placed, by a solemn testament, the sceptre of the east in the
      hands of jezdegerd himself. the royal guardian accepted and
      discharged this honorable trust with unexampled fidelity; and the
      infancy of theodosius was protected by the arms and councils of
      persia. such is the singular narrative of procopius; and his
      veracity is not disputed by agathias, 64 while he presumes to
      dissent from his judgment, and to arraign the wisdom of a
      christian emperor, who, so rashly, though so fortunately,
      committed his son and his dominions to the unknown faith of a
      stranger, a rival, and a heathen. at the distance of one hundred
      and fifty years, this political question might be debated in the
      court of justinian; but a prudent historian will refuse to
      examine the propriety, till he has ascertained the truth, of the
      testament of arcadius. as it stands without a parallel in the
      history of the world, we may justly require, that it should be
      attested by the positive and unanimous evidence of
      contemporaries. the strange novelty of the event, which excites
      our distrust, must have attracted their notice; and their
      universal silence annihilates the vain tradition of the
      succeeding age.

      this fable. his criticism was not warped by any ecclesiastical

      the maxims of roman jurisprudence, if they could fairly be
      transferred from private property to public dominion, would have
      adjudged to the emperor honorius the guardianship of his nephew,
      till he had attained, at least, the fourteenth year of his age.
      but the weakness of honorius, and the calamities of his reign,
      disqualified him from prosecuting this natural claim; and such
      was the absolute separation of the two monarchies, both in
      interest and affection, that constantinople would have obeyed,
      with less reluctance, the orders of the persian, than those of
      the italian, court. under a prince whose weakness is disguised by
      the external signs of manhood and discretion, the most worthless
      favorites may secretly dispute the empire of the palace; and
      dictate to submissive provinces the commands of a master, whom
      they direct and despise. but the ministers of a child, who is
      incapable of arming them with the sanction of the royal name,
      must acquire and exercise an independent authority. the great
      officers of the state and army, who had been appointed before the
      death of arcadius, formed an aristocracy, which might have
      inspired them with the idea of a free republic; and the
      government of the eastern empire was fortunately assumed by the
      prfect anthemius, 65 who obtained, by his superior abilities, a
      lasting ascendant over the minds of his equals. the safety of the
      young emperor proved the merit and integrity of anthemius; and
      his prudent firmness sustained the force and reputation of an
      infant reign. uldin, with a formidable host of barbarians, was
      encamped in the heart of thrace; he proudly rejected all terms of
      accommodation; and, pointing to the rising sun, declared to the
      roman ambassadors, that the course of that planet should alone
      terminate the conquest of the huns. but the desertion of his
      confederates, who were privately convinced of the justice and
      liberality of the imperial ministers, obliged uldin to repass the
      danube: the tribe of the scyrri, which composed his rear-guard,
      was almost extirpated; and many thousand captives were dispersed
      to cultivate, with servile labor, the fields of asia. 66 in the
      midst of the public triumph, constantinople was protected by a
      strong enclosure of new and more extensive walls; the same
      vigilant care was applied to restore the fortifications of the
      illyrian cities; and a plan was judiciously conceived, which, in
      the space of seven years, would have secured the command of the
      danube, by establishing on that river a perpetual fleet of two
      hundred and fifty armed vessels. 67

      but the romans had so long been accustomed to the authority of a
      monarch, that the first, even among the females, of the imperial
      family, who displayed any courage or capacity, was permitted to
      ascend the vacant throne of theodosius. his sister pulcheria, 68
      who was only two years older than himself, received, at the age
      of sixteen, the title of augusta; and though her favor might be
      sometimes clouded by caprice or intrigue, she continued to govern
      the eastern empire near forty years; during the long minority of
      her brother, and after his death, in her own name, and in the
      name of marcian, her nominal husband. from a motive either of
      prudence or religion, she embraced a life of celibacy; and
      notwithstanding some aspersions on the chastity of pulcheria, 69
      this resolution, which she communicated to her sisters arcadia
      and marina, was celebrated by the christian world, as the sublime
      effort of heroic piety. in the presence of the clergy and people,
      the three daughters of arcadius 70 dedicated their virginity to
      god; and the obligation of their solemn vow was inscribed on a
      tablet of gold and gems; which they publicly offered in the great
      church of constantinople. their palace was converted into a
      monastery; and all males, except the guides of their conscience,
      the saints who had forgotten the distinction of sexes, were
      scrupulously excluded from the holy threshold. pulcheria, her two
      sisters, and a chosen train of favorite damsels, formed a
      religious community: they denounced the vanity of dress;
      interrupted, by frequent fasts, their simple and frugal diet;
      allotted a portion of their time to works of embroidery; and
      devoted several hours of the day and night to the exercises of
      prayer and psalmody. the piety of a christian virgin was adorned
      by the zeal and liberality of an empress. ecclesiastical history
      describes the splendid churches, which were built at the expense
      of pulcheria, in all the provinces of the east; her charitable
      foundations for the benefit of strangers and the poor; the ample
      donations which she assigned for the perpetual maintenance of
      monastic societies; and the active severity with which she
      labored to suppress the opposite heresies of nestorius and
      eutyches. such virtues were supposed to deserve the peculiar
      favor of the deity: and the relics of martyrs, as well as the
      knowledge of future events, were communicated in visions and
      revelations to the imperial saint. 71 yet the devotion of
      pulcheria never diverted her indefatigable attention from
      temporal affairs; and she alone, among all the descendants of the
      great theodosius, appears to have inherited any share of his
      manly spirit and abilities. the elegant and familiar use which
      she had acquired, both of the greek and latin languages, was
      readily applied to the various occasions of speaking or writing,
      on public business: her deliberations were maturely weighed; her
      actions were prompt and decisive; and, while she moved, without
      noise or ostentation, the wheel of government, she discreetly
      attributed to the genius of the emperor the long tranquillity of
      his reign. in the last years of his peaceful life, europe was
      indeed afflicted by the arms of war; but the more extensive
      provinces of asia still continued to enjoy a profound and
      permanent repose. theodosius the younger was never reduced to the
      disgraceful necessity of encountering and punishing a rebellious
      subject: and since we cannot applaud the vigor, some praise may
      be due to the mildness and prosperity, of the administration of
      pulcheria.

      to a church of st. thyrsus, erected by caesarius, who was consul
      a.d. 397; and the memory of the relics was almost obliterated.
      notwithstanding the charitable wishes of dr. jortin, (remarks,
      tom. iv. p. 234,) it is not easy to acquit pulcheria of some
      share in the pious fraud; which must have been transacted when
      she was more than five-and-thirty years of age.]

      the roman world was deeply interested in the education of its
      master. a regular course of study and exercise was judiciously
      instituted; of the military exercises of riding, and shooting
      with the bow; of the liberal studies of grammar, rhetoric, and
      philosophy: the most skilful masters of the east ambitiously
      solicited the attention of their royal pupil; and several noble
      youths were introduced into the palace, to animate his diligence
      by the emulation of friendship. pulcheria alone discharged the
      important task of instructing her brother in the arts of
      government; but her precepts may countenance some suspicions of
      the extent of her capacity, or of the purity of her intentions.
      she taught him to maintain a grave and majestic deportment; to
      walk, to hold his robes, to seat himself on his throne, in a
      manner worthy of a great prince; to abstain from laughter; to
      listen with condescension; to return suitable answers; to assume,
      by turns, a serious or a placid countenance: in a word, to
      represent with grace and dignity the external figure of a roman
      emperor. but theodosius 72 was never excited to support the
      weight and glory of an illustrious name: and, instead of aspiring
      to support his ancestors, he degenerated (if we may presume to
      measure the degrees of incapacity) below the weakness of his
      father and his uncle. arcadius and honorius had been assisted by
      the guardian care of a parent, whose lessons were enforced by his
      authority and example. but the unfortunate prince, who is born in
      the purple, must remain a stranger to the voice of truth; and the
      son of arcadius was condemned to pass his perpetual infancy
      encompassed only by a servile train of women and eunuchs. the
      ample leisure which he acquired by neglecting the essential
      duties of his high office, was filled by idle amusements and
      unprofitable studies. hunting was the only active pursuit that
      could tempt him beyond the limits of the palace; but he most
      assiduously labored, sometimes by the light of a midnight lamp,
      in the mechanic occupations of painting and carving; and the
      elegance with which he transcribed religious books entitled the
      roman emperor to the singular epithet of calligraphes, or a fair
      writer. separated from the world by an impenetrable veil,
      theodosius trusted the persons whom he loved; he loved those who
      were accustomed to amuse and flatter his indolence; and as he
      never perused the papers that were presented for the royal
      signature, the acts of injustice the most repugnant to his
      character were frequently perpetrated in his name. the emperor
      himself was chaste, temperate, liberal, and merciful; but these
      qualities, which can only deserve the name of virtues when they
      are supported by courage and regulated by discretion, were seldom
      beneficial, and they sometimes proved mischievous, to mankind.
      his mind, enervated by a royal education, was oppressed and
      degraded by abject superstition: he fasted, he sung psalms, he
      blindly accepted the miracles and doctrines with which his faith
      was continually nourished. theodosius devoutly worshipped the
      dead and living saints of the catholic church; and he once
      refused to eat, till an insolent monk, who had cast an
      excommunication on his sovereign, condescended to heal the
      spiritual wound which he had inflicted. 73

      ecclesiastical historians, who in general bear so close a
      resemblance. sozomen (l. ix. c. 1) ascribes to pulcheria the
      government of the empire, and the education of her brother, whom
      he scarcely condescends to praise. socrates, though he affectedly
      disclaims all hopes of favor or fame, composes an elaborate
      panegyric on the emperor, and cautiously suppresses the merits of
      his sister, (l. vii. c. 22, 42.) philostorgius (l. xii. c. 7)

      the story of a fair and virtuous maiden, exalted from a private
      condition to the imperial throne, might be deemed an incredible
      romance, if such a romance had not been verified in the marriage
      of theodosius. the celebrated athenais 74 was educated by her
      father leontius in the religion and sciences of the greeks; and
      so advantageous was the opinion which the athenian philosopher
      entertained of his contemporaries, that he divided his patrimony
      between his two sons, bequeathing to his daughter a small legacy
      of one hundred pieces of gold, in the lively confidence that her
      beauty and merit would be a sufficient portion. the jealousy and
      avarice of her brothers soon compelled athenais to seek a refuge
      at constantinople; and, with some hopes, either of justice or
      favor, to throw herself at the feet of pulcheria. that sagacious
      princess listened to her eloquent complaint; and secretly
      destined the daughter of the philosopher leontius for the future
      wife of the emperor of the east, who had now attained the
      twentieth year of his age. she easily excited the curiosity of
      her brother, by an interesting picture of the charms of athenais;
      large eyes, a well-proportioned nose, a fair complexion, golden
      locks, a slender person, a graceful demeanor, an understanding
      improved by study, and a virtue tried by distress. theodosius,
      concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his sister, was
      permitted to behold the athenian virgin: the modest youth
      immediately declared his pure and honorable love; and the royal
      nuptials were celebrated amidst the acclamations of the capital
      and the provinces. athenais, who was easily persuaded to renounce
      the errors of paganism, received at her baptism the christian
      name of eudocia; but the cautious pulcheria withheld the title of
      augusta, till the wife of theodosius had approved her
      fruitfulness by the birth of a daughter, who espoused, fifteen
      years afterwards, the emperor of the west. the brothers of
      eudocia obeyed, with some anxiety, her imperial summons; but as
      she could easily forgive their unfortunate unkindness, she
      indulged the tenderness, or perhaps the vanity, of a sister, by
      promoting them to the rank of consuls and prfects. in the
      luxury of the palace, she still cultivated those ingenuous arts
      which had contributed to her greatness; and wisely dedicated her
      talents to the honor of religion, and of her husband. eudocia
      composed a poetical paraphrase of the first eight books of the
      old testament, and of the prophecies of daniel and zechariah; a
      cento of the verses of homer, applied to the life and miracles of
      christ, the legend of st. cyprian, and a panegyric on the persian
      victories of theodosius; and her writings, which were applauded
      by a servile and superstitious age, have not been disdained by
      the candor of impartial criticism. 75 the fondness of the emperor
      was not abated by time and possession; and eudocia, after the
      marriage of her daughter, was permitted to discharge her grateful
      vows by a solemn pilgrimage to jerusalem. her ostentatious
      progress through the east may seem inconsistent with the spirit
      of christian humility; she pronounced, from a throne of gold and
      gems, an eloquent oration to the senate of antioch, declared her
      royal intention of enlarging the walls of the city, bestowed a
      donative of two hundred pounds of gold to restore the public
      baths, and accepted the statues, which were decreed by the
      gratitude of antioch. in the holy land, her alms and pious
      foundations exceeded the munificence of the great helena, and
      though the public treasure might be impoverished by this
      excessive liberality, she enjoyed the conscious satisfaction of
      returning to constantinople with the chains of st. peter, the
      right arm of st. stephen, and an undoubted picture of the virgin,
      painted by st. luke. 76 but this pilgrimage was the fatal term of
      the glories of eudocia. satiated with empty pomp, and unmindful,
      perhaps, of her obligations to pulcheria, she ambitiously aspired
      to the government of the eastern empire; the palace was
      distracted by female discord; but the victory was at last
      decided, by the superior ascendant of the sister of theodosius.
      the execution of paulinus, master of the offices, and the
      disgrace of cyrus, prtorian prfect of the east, convinced the
      public that the favor of eudocia was insufficient to protect her
      most faithful friends; and the uncommon beauty of paulinus
      encouraged the secret rumor, that his guilt was that of a
      successful lover. 77 as soon as the empress perceived that the
      affection of theodosius was irretrievably lost, she requested the
      permission of retiring to the distant solitude of jerusalem. she
      obtained her request; but the jealousy of theodosius, or the
      vindictive spirit of pulcheria, pursued her in her last retreat;
      and saturninus, count of the domestics, was directed to punish
      with death two ecclesiastics, her most favored servants. eudocia
      instantly revenged them by the assassination of the count; the
      furious passions which she indulged on this suspicious occasion,
      seemed to justify the severity of theodosius; and the empress,
      ignominiously stripped of the honors of her rank, 78 was
      disgraced, perhaps unjustly, in the eyes of the world. the
      remainder of the life of eudocia, about sixteen years, was spent
      in exile and devotion; and the approach of age, the death of
      theodosius, the misfortunes of her only daughter, who was led a
      captive from rome to carthage, and the society of the holy monks
      of palestine, insensibly confirmed the religious temper of her
      mind. after a full experience of the vicissitudes of human life,
      the daughter of the philosopher leontius expired, at jerusalem,
      in the sixty-seventh year of her age; protesting, with her dying
      breath, that she had never transgressed the bounds of innocence
      and friendship. 79

      the gentle mind of theodosius was never inflamed by the ambition
      of conquest, or military renown; and the slight alarm of a
      persian war scarcely interrupted the tranquillity of the east.
      the motives of this war were just and honorable. in the last year
      of the reign of jezdegerd, the supposed guardian of theodosius, a
      bishop, who aspired to the crown of martyrdom, destroyed one of
      the fire-temples of susa. 80 his zeal and obstinacy were revenged
      on his brethren: the magi excited a cruel persecution; and the
      intolerant zeal of jezdegerd was imitated by his son varanes, or
      bahram, who soon afterwards ascended the throne. some christian
      fugitives, who escaped to the roman frontier, were sternly
      demanded, and generously refused; and the refusal, aggravated by
      commercial disputes, soon kindled a war between the rival
      monarchies. the mountains of armenia, and the plains of
      mesopotamia, were filled with hostile armies; but the operations
      of two successive campaigns were not productive of any decisive
      or memorable events. some engagements were fought, some towns
      were besieged, with various and doubtful success: and if the
      romans failed in their attempt to recover the long-lost
      possession of nisibis, the persians were repulsed from the walls
      of a mesopotamian city, by the valor of a martial bishop, who
      pointed his thundering engine in the name of st. thomas the
      apostle. yet the splendid victories which the incredible speed of
      the messenger palladius repeatedly announced to the palace of
      constantinople, were celebrated with festivals and panegyrics.
      from these panegyrics the historians 81 of the age might borrow
      their extraordinary, and, perhaps, fabulous tales; of the proud
      challenge of a persian hero, who was entangled by the net, and
      despatched by the sword, of areobindus the goth; of the ten
      thousand immortals, who were slain in the attack of the roman
      camp; and of the hundred thousand arabs, or saracens, who were
      impelled by a panic terror to throw themselves headlong into the
      euphrates. such events may be disbelieved or disregarded; but the
      charity of a bishop, acacius of amida, whose name might have
      dignified the saintly calendar, shall not be lost in oblivion.
      boldly declaring, that vases of gold and silver are useless to a
      god who neither eats nor drinks, the generous prelate sold the
      plate of the church of amida; employed the price in the
      redemption of seven thousand persian captives; supplied their
      wants with affectionate liberality; and dismissed them to their
      native country, to inform their king of the true spirit of the
      religion which he persecuted. the practice of benevolence in the
      midst of war must always tend to assuage the animosity of
      contending nations; and i wish to persuade myself, that acacius
      contributed to the restoration of peace. in the conference which
      was held on the limits of the two empires, the roman ambassadors
      degraded the personal character of their sovereign, by a vain
      attempt to magnify the extent of his power; when they seriously
      advised the persians to prevent, by a timely accommodation, the
      wrath of a monarch, who was yet ignorant of this distant war. a
      truce of one hundred years was solemnly ratified; and although
      the revolutions of armenia might threaten the public
      tranquillity, the essential conditions of this treaty were
      respected near fourscore years by the successors of constantine
      and artaxerxes.

      since the roman and parthian standards first encountered on the
      banks of the euphrates, the kingdom of armenia 82 was alternately
      oppressed by its formidable protectors; and in the course of this
      history, several events, which inclined the balance of peace and
      war, have been already related. a disgraceful treaty had resigned
      armenia to the ambition of sapor; and the scale of persia
      appeared to preponderate. but the royal race of arsaces
      impatiently submitted to the house of sassan; the turbulent
      nobles asserted, or betrayed, their hereditary independence; and
      the nation was still attached to the christian princes of
      constantinople. in the beginning of the fifth century, armenia
      was divided by the progress of war and faction; 83 and the
      unnatural division precipitated the downfall of that ancient
      monarchy. chosroes, the persian vassal, reigned over the eastern
      and most extensive portion of the country; while the western
      province acknowledged the jurisdiction of arsaces, and the
      supremacy of the emperor arcadius. 8111 after the death of
      arsaces, the romans suppressed the regal government, and imposed
      on their allies the condition of subjects. the military command
      was delegated to the count of the armenian frontier; the city of
      theodosiopolis 84 was built and fortified in a strong situation,
      on a fertile and lofty ground, near the sources of the euphrates;
      and the dependent territories were ruled by five satraps, whose
      dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple. the
      less fortunate nobles, who lamented the loss of their king, and
      envied the honors of their equals, were provoked to negotiate
      their peace and pardon at the persian court; and returning, with
      their followers, to the palace of artaxata, acknowledged chosroes
      8411 for their lawful sovereign. about thirty years afterwards,
      artasires, the nephew and successor of chosroes, fell under the
      displeasure of the haughty and capricious nobles of armenia; and
      they unanimously desired a persian governor in the room of an
      unworthy king. the answer of the archbishop isaac, whose sanction
      they earnestly solicited, is expressive of the character of a
      superstitious people. he deplored the manifest and inexcusable
      vices of artasires; and declared, that he should not hesitate to
      accuse him before the tribunal of a christian emperor, who would
      punish, without destroying, the sinner. our king, continued
      isaac, is too much addicted to licentious pleasures, but he has
      been purified in the holy waters of baptism. he is a lover of
      women, but he does not adore the fire or the elements. he may
      deserve the reproach of lewdness, but he is an undoubted
      catholic; and his faith is pure, though his manners are
      flagitious. i will never consent to abandon my sheep to the rage
      of devouring wolves; and you would soon repent your rash exchange
      of the infirmities of a believer, for the specious virtues of a
      heathen. 85 exasperated by the firmness of isaac, the factious
      nobles accused both the king and the archbishop as the secret
      adherents of the emperor; and absurdly rejoiced in the sentence
      of condemnation, which, after a partial hearing, was solemnly
      pronounced by bahram himself. the descendants of arsaces were
      degraded from the royal dignity, 86 which they had possessed
      above five hundred and sixty years; 87 and the dominions of the
      unfortunate artasires, 8711 under the new and significant
      appellation of persarmenia, were reduced into the form of a
      province. this usurpation excited the jealousy of the roman
      government; but the rising disputes were soon terminated by an
      amicable, though unequal, partition of the ancient kingdom of
      armenia: 8712 and a territorial acquisition, which augustus might
      have despised, reflected some lustre on the declining empire of
      the younger theodosius.

      during a long and disgraceful reign of twenty-eight years,
      honorius, emperor of the west, was separated from the friendship
      of his brother, and afterwards of his nephew, who reigned over
      the east; and constantinople beheld, with apparent indifference
      and secret joy, the calamities of rome. the strange adventures of
      placidia 1 gradually renewed and cemented the alliance of the two
      empires. the daughter of the great theodosius had been the
      captive, and the queen, of the goths; she lost an affectionate
      husband; she was dragged in chains by his insulting assassin; she
      tasted the pleasure of revenge, and was exchanged, in the treaty
      of peace, for six hundred thousand measures of wheat. after her
      return from spain to italy, placidia experienced a new
      persecution in the bosom of her family. she was averse to a
      marriage, which had been stipulated without her consent; and the
      brave constantius, as a noble reward for the tyrants whom he had
      vanquished, received, from the hand of honorius himself, the
      struggling and the reluctant hand of the widow of adolphus. but
      her resistance ended with the ceremony of the nuptials: nor did
      placidia refuse to become the mother of honoria and valentinian
      the third, or to assume and exercise an absolute dominion over
      the mind of her grateful husband. the generous soldier, whose
      time had hitherto been divided between social pleasure and
      military service, was taught new lessons of avarice and ambition:
      he extorted the title of augustus: and the servant of honorius
      was associated to the empire of the west. the death of
      constantius, in the seventh month of his reign, instead of
      diminishing, seemed to inerease the power of placidia; and the
      indecent familiarity 2 of her brother, which might be no more
      than the symptoms of a childish affection, were universally
      attributed to incestuous love. on a sudden, by some base
      intrigues of a steward and a nurse, this excessive fondness was
      converted into an irreconcilable quarrel: the debates of the
      emperor and his sister were not long confined within the walls of
      the palace; and as the gothic soldiers adhered to their queen,
      the city of ravenna was agitated with bloody and dangerous
      tumults, which could only be appeased by the forced or voluntary
      retreat of placidia and her children. the royal exiles landed at
      constantinople, soon after the marriage of theodosius, during the
      festival of the persian victories. they were treated with
      kindness and magnificence; but as the statues of the emperor
      constantius had been rejected by the eastern court, the title of
      augusta could not decently be allowed to his widow. within a few
      months after the arrival of placidia, a swift messenger announced
      the death of honorius, the consequence of a dropsy; but the
      important secret was not divulged, till the necessary orders had
      been despatched for the march of a large body of troops to the
      sea-coast of dalmatia. the shops and the gates of constantinople
      remained shut during seven days; and the loss of a foreign
      prince, who could neither be esteemed nor regretted, was
      celebrated with loud and affected demonstrations of the public
      grief.

      of italy, and the hope of an alliance with the huns, john
      presumed to insult, by an embassy, the majesty of the eastern
      emperor; but when he understood that his agents had been
      banished, imprisoned, and at length chased away with deserved
      ignominy, john prepared to assert, by arms, the injustice of his
      claims. in such a cause, the grandson of the great theodosius
      should have marched in person: but the young emperor was easily
      diverted, by his physicians, from so rash and hazardous a design;
      and the conduct of the italian expedition was prudently intrusted
      to ardaburius, and his son aspar, who had already signalized
      their valor against the persians. it was resolved, that
      ardaburius should embark with the infantry; whilst aspar, at the
      head of the cavalry, conducted placidia and her son valentinian
      along the sea-coast of the adriatic. the march of the cavalry was
      performed with such active diligence, that they surprised,
      without resistance, the important city of aquileia: when the
      hopes of aspar were unexpectedly confounded by the intelligence,
      that a storm had dispersed the imperial fleet; and that his
      father, with only two galleys, was taken and carried a prisoner
      into the port of ravenna. yet this incident, unfortunate as it
      might seem, facilitated the conquest of italy. ardaburius
      employed, or abused, the courteous freedom which he was permitted
      to enjoy, to revive among the troops a sense of loyalty and
      gratitude; and as soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution,
      he invited, by private messages, and pressed the approach of,
      aspar. a shepherd, whom the popular credulity transformed into an
      angel, guided the eastern cavalry by a secret, and, it was
      thought, an impassable road, through the morasses of the po: the
      gates of ravenna, after a short struggle, were thrown open; and
      the defenceless tyrant was delivered to the mercy, or rather to
      the cruelty, of the conquerors. his right hand was first cut off;
      and, after he had been exposed, mounted on an ass, to the public
      derision, john was beheaded in the circus of aquileia. the
      emperor theodosius, when he received the news of the victory,
      interrupted the horse-races; and singing, as he marched through
      the streets, a suitable psalm, conducted his people from the
      hippodrome to the church, where he spent the remainder of the day
      in grateful devotion. 3

      in a monarchy, which, according to various precedents, might be
      considered as elective, or hereditary, or patrimonial, it was
      impossible that the intricate claims of female and collateral
      succession should be clearly defined; 4 and theodosius, by the
      right of consanguinity or conquest, might have reigned the sole
      legitimate emperor of the romans. for a moment, perhaps, his eyes
      were dazzled by the prospect of unbounded sway; but his indolent
      temper gradually acquiesced in the dictates of sound policy. he
      contented himself with the possession of the east; and wisely
      relinquished the laborious task of waging a distant and doubtful
      war against the barbarians beyond the alps; or of securing the
      obedience of the italians and africans, whose minds were
      alienated by the irreconcilable difference of language and
      interest. instead of listening to the voice of ambition,
      theodosius resolved to imitate the moderation of his grandfather,
      and to seat his cousin valentinian on the throne of the west. the
      royal infant was distinguished at constantinople by the title of
      nobilissimus: he was promoted, before his departure from
      thessalonica, to the rank and dignity of caesar; and after the
      conquest of italy, the patrician helion, by the authority of
      theodosius, and in the presence of the senate, saluted
      valentinian the third by the name of augustus, and solemnly
      invested him with the diadem and the imperial purple. 5 by the
      agreement of the three females who governed the roman world, the
      son of placidia was betrothed to eudoxia, the daughter of
      theodosius and athenais; and as soon as the lover and his bride
      had attained the age of puberty, this honorable alliance was
      faithfully accomplished. at the same time, as a compensation,
      perhaps, for the expenses of the war, the western illyricum was
      detached from the italian dominions, and yielded to the throne of
      constantinople. 6 the emperor of the east acquired the useful
      dominion of the rich and maritime province of dalmatia, and the
      dangerous sovereignty of pannonia and noricum, which had been
      filled and ravaged above twenty years by a promiscuous crowd of
      huns, ostrogoths, vandals, and bavarians. theodosius and
      valentinian continued to respect the obligations of their public
      and domestic alliance; but the unity of the roman government was
      finally dissolved. by a positive declaration, the validity of all
      future laws was limited to the dominions of their peculiar
      author; unless he should think proper to communicate them,
      subscribed with his own hand, for the approbation of his
      independent colleague. 7

      forty years before that time, the unity of legislation had been
      proved by an exception. the jews, who were numerous in the cities
      of apulia and calabria, produced a law of the east to justify
      their exemption from municipal offices, (cod. theod. l. xvi. tit.
      viii. leg. 13;) and the western emperor was obliged to
      invalidate, by a special edict, the law, quam constat meis
      partibus esse damnosam. cod. theod. l. xi. tit. i. leg. 158.]

      valentinian, when he received the title of augustus, was no more
      than six years of age; and his long minority was intrusted to the
      guardian care of a mother, who might assert a female claim to the
      succession of the western empire. placidia envied, but she could
      not equal, the reputation and virtues of the wife and sister of
      theodosius, the elegant genius of eudocia, the wise and
      successful policy of pulcheria. the mother of valentinian was
      jealous of the power which she was incapable of exercising; 8 she
      reigned twenty-five years, in the name of her son; and the
      character of that unworthy emperor gradually countenanced the
      suspicion that placidia had enervated his youth by a dissolute
      education, and studiously diverted his attention from every manly
      and honorable pursuit. amidst the decay of military spirit, her
      armies were commanded by two generals, tius 9 and boniface, 10
      who may be deservedly named as the last of the romans. their
      union might have supported a sinking empire; their discord was
      the fatal and immediate cause of the loss of africa. the invasion
      and defeat of attila have immortalized the fame of tius; and
      though time has thrown a shade over the exploits of his rival,
      the defence of marseilles, and the deliverance of africa, attest
      the military talents of count boniface. in the field of battle,
      in partial encounters, in single combats, he was still the terror
      of the barbarians: the clergy, and particularly his friend
      augustin, were edified by the christian piety which had once
      tempted him to retire from the world; the people applauded his
      spotless integrity; the army dreaded his equal and inexorable
      justice, which may be displayed in a very singular example. a
      peasant, who complained of the criminal intimacy between his wife
      and a gothic soldier, was directed to attend his tribunal the
      following day: in the evening the count, who had diligently
      informed himself of the time and place of the assignation,
      mounted his horse, rode ten miles into the country, surprised the
      guilty couple, punished the soldier with instant death, and
      silenced the complaints of the husband by presenting him, the
      next morning, with the head of the adulterer. the abilities of
      tius and boniface might have been usefully employed against the
      public enemies, in separate and important commands; but the
      experience of their past conduct should have decided the real
      favor and confidence of the empress placidia. in the melancholy
      season of her exile and distress, boniface alone had maintained
      her cause with unshaken fidelity: and the troops and treasures of
      africa had essentially contributed to extinguish the rebellion.
      the same rebellion had been supported by the zeal and activity of
      tius, who brought an army of sixty thousand huns from the
      danube to the confines of italy, for the service of the usurper.
      the untimely death of john compelled him to accept an
      advantageous treaty; but he still continued, the subject and the
      soldier of valentinian, to entertain a secret, perhaps a
      treasonable, correspondence with his barbarian allies, whose
      retreat had been purchased by liberal gifts, and more liberal
      promises. but tius possessed an advantage of singular moment in
      a female reign; he was present: he besieged, with artful and
      assiduous flattery, the palace of ravenna; disguised his dark
      designs with the mask of loyalty and friendship; and at length
      deceived both his mistress and his absent rival, by a subtle
      conspiracy, which a weak woman and a brave man could not easily
      suspect. he had secretly persuaded 11 placidia to recall boniface
      from the government of africa; he secretly advised boniface to
      disobey the imperial summons: to the one, he represented the
      order as a sentence of death; to the other, he stated the refusal
      as a signal of revolt; and when the credulous and unsuspectful
      count had armed the province in his defence, tius applauded his
      sagacity in foreseeing the rebellion, which his own perfidy had
      excited. a temperate inquiry into the real motives of boniface
      would have restored a faithful servant to his duty and to the
      republic; but the arts of tius still continued to betray and to
      inflame, and the count was urged, by persecution, to embrace the
      most desperate counsels. the success with which he eluded or
      repelled the first attacks, could not inspire a vain confidence,
      that at the head of some loose, disorderly africans, he should be
      able to withstand the regular forces of the west, commanded by a
      rival, whose military character it was impossible for him to
      despise. after some hesitation, the last struggles of prudence
      and loyalty, boniface despatched a trusty friend to the court, or
      rather to the camp, of gonderic, king of the vandals, with the
      proposal of a strict alliance, and the offer of an advantageous
      and perpetual settlement.

      after the retreat of the goths, the authority of honorius had
      obtained a precarious establishment in spain; except only in the
      province of gallicia, where the suevi and the vandals had
      fortified their camps, in mutual discord and hostile
      independence. the vandals prevailed; and their adversaries were
      besieged in the nervasian hills, between leon and oviedo, till
      the approach of count asterius compelled, or rather provoked, the
      victorious barbarians to remove the scene of the war to the
      plains of boetica. the rapid progress of the vandals soon
      acquired a more effectual opposition; and the master-general
      castinus marched against them with a numerous army of romans and
      goths. vanquished in battle by an inferior army, castinus fled
      with dishonor to tarragona; and this memorable defeat, which has
      been represented as the punishment, was most probably the effect,
      of his rash presumption. 12 seville and carthagena became the
      reward, or rather the prey, of the ferocious conquerors; and the
      vessels which they found in the harbor of carthagena might easily
      transport them to the isles of majorca and minorca, where the
      spanish fugitives, as in a secure recess, had vainly concealed
      their families and their fortunes. the experience of navigation,
      and perhaps the prospect of africa, encouraged the vandals to
      accept the invitation which they received from count boniface;
      and the death of gonderic served only to forward and animate the
      bold enterprise. in the room of a prince not conspicuous for any
      superior powers of the mind or body, they acquired his bastard
      brother, the terrible genseric; 13 a name, which, in the
      destruction of the roman empire, has deserved an equal rank with
      the names of alaric and attila. the king of the vandals is
      described to have been of a middle stature, with a lameness in
      one leg, which he had contracted by an accidental fall from his
      horse. his slow and cautious speech seldom declared the deep
      purposes of his soul; he disdained to imitate the luxury of the
      vanquished; but he indulged the sterner passions of anger and
      revenge. the ambition of genseric was without bounds and without
      scruples; and the warrior could dexterously employ the dark
      engines of policy to solicit the allies who might be useful to
      his success, or to scatter among his enemies the seeds of hatred
      and contention. almost in the moment of his departure he was
      informed that hermanric, king of the suevi, had presumed to
      ravage the spanish territories, which he was resolved to abandon.

      impatient of the insult, genseric pursued the hasty retreat of
      the suevi as far as merida; precipitated the king and his army
      into the river anas, and calmly returned to the sea-shore to
      embark his victorious troops. the vessels which transported the
      vandals over the modern straits of gibraltar, a channel only
      twelve miles in breadth, were furnished by the spaniards, who
      anxiously wished their departure; and by the african general, who
      had implored their formidable assistance. 14

      our fancy, so long accustomed to exaggerate and multiply the
      martial swarms of barbarians that seemed to issue from the north,
      will perhaps be surprised by the account of the army which
      genseric mustered on the coast of mauritania. the vandals, who in
      twenty years had penetrated from the elbe to mount atlas, were
      united under the command of their warlike king; and he reigned
      with equal authority over the alani, who had passed, within the
      term of human life, from the cold of scythia to the excessive
      heat of an african climate. the hopes of the bold enterprise had
      excited many brave adventurers of the gothic nation; and many
      desperate provincials were tempted to repair their fortunes by
      the same means which had occasioned their ruin. yet this various
      multitude amounted only to fifty thousand effective men; and
      though genseric artfully magnified his apparent strength, by
      appointing eighty chinarchs, or commanders of thousands, the
      fallacious increase of old men, of children, and of slaves, would
      scarcely have swelled his army to the number of four-score
      thousand persons. 15 but his own dexterity, and the discontents
      of africa, soon fortified the vandal powers, by the accession of
      numerous and active allies. the parts of mauritania which border
      on the great desert and the atlantic ocean, were filled with a
      fierce and untractable race of men, whose savage temper had been
      exasperated, rather than reclaimed, by their dread of the roman
      arms. the wandering moors, 16 as they gradually ventured to
      approach the seashore, and the camp of the vandals, must have
      viewed with terror and astonishment the dress, the armor, the
      martial pride and discipline of the unknown strangers who had
      landed on their coast; and the fair complexions of the blue-eyed
      warriors of germany formed a very singular contrast with the
      swarthy or olive hue which is derived from the neighborhood of
      the torrid zone. after the first difficulties had in some measure
      been removed, which arose from the mutual ignorance of their
      respective language, the moors, regardless of any future
      consequence, embraced the alliance of the enemies of rome; and a
      crowd of naked savages rushed from the woods and valleys of mount
      atlas, to satiate their revenge on the polished tyrants, who had
      injuriously expelled them from the native sovereignty of the
      land.

      the persecution of the donatists 17 was an event not less
      favorable to the designs of genseric. seventeen years before he
      landed in africa, a public conference was held at carthage, by
      the order of the magistrate. the catholics were satisfied, that,
      after the invincible reasons which they had alleged, the
      obstinacy of the schismatics must be inexcusable and voluntary;
      and the emperor honorius was persuaded to inflict the most
      rigorous penalties on a faction which had so long abused his
      patience and clemency. three hundred bishops, 18 with many
      thousands of the inferior clergy, were torn from their churches,
      stripped of their ecclesiastical possessions, banished to the
      islands, and proscribed by the laws, if they presumed to conceal
      themselves in the provinces of africa. their numerous
      congregations, both in cities and in the country, were deprived
      of the rights of citizens, and of the exercise of religious
      worship. a regular scale of fines, from ten to two hundred pounds
      of silver, was curiously ascertained, according to the
      distinction of rank and fortune, to punish the crime of assisting
      at a schismatic conventicle; and if the fine had been levied five
      times, without subduing the obstinacy of the offender, his future
      punishment was referred to the discretion of the imperial court.
      19 by these severities, which obtained the warmest approbation of
      st. augustin, 20 great numbers of donatists were reconciled to
      the catholic church; but the fanatics, who still persevered in
      their opposition, were provoked to madness and despair; the
      distracted country was filled with tumult and bloodshed; the
      armed troops of circumcellions alternately pointed their rage
      against themselves, or against their adversaries; and the
      calendar of martyrs received on both sides a considerable
      augmentation. 21 under these circumstances, genseric, a
      christian, but an enemy of the orthodox communion, showed himself
      to the donatists as a powerful deliverer, from whom they might
      reasonably expect the repeal of the odious and oppressive edicts
      of the roman emperors. 22 the conquest of africa was facilitated
      by the active zeal, or the secret favor, of a domestic faction;
      the wanton outrages against the churches and the clergy of which
      the vandals are accused, may be fairly imputed to the fanaticism
      of their allies; and the intolerant spirit which disgraced the

      the court and the people were astonished by the strange
      intelligence, that a virtuous hero, after so many favors, and so
      many services, had renounced his allegiance, and invited the
      barbarians to destroy the province intrusted to his command. the
      friends of boniface, who still believed that his criminal
      behavior might be excused by some honorable motive, solicited,
      during the absence of tius, a free conference with the count of
      africa; and darius, an officer of high distinction, was named for
      the important embassy. 24 in their first interview at carthage,
      the imaginary provocations were mutually explained; the opposite
      letters of tius were produced and compared; and the fraud was
      easily detected. placidia and boniface lamented their fatal
      error; and the count had sufficient magnanimity to confide in the
      forgiveness of his sovereign, or to expose his head to her future
      resentment. his repentance was fervent and sincere; but he soon
      discovered that it was no longer in his power to restore the
      edifice which he had shaken to its foundations. carthage and the
      roman garrisons returned with their general to the allegiance of
      valentinian; but the rest of africa was still distracted with war
      and faction; and the inexorable king of the vandals, disdaining
      all terms of accommodation, sternly refused to relinquish the
      possession of his prey. the band of veterans who marched under
      the standard of boniface, and his hasty levies of provincial
      troops, were defeated with considerable loss; the victorious
      barbarians insulted the open country; and carthage, cirta, and
      hippo regius, were the only cities that appeared to rise above
      the general inundation.

      24 (return) [ in a confidential letter to count boniface, st.
      augustin, without examining the grounds of the quarrel, piously
      exhorts him to discharge the duties of a christian and a subject:
      to extricate himself without delay from his dangerous and guilty
      situation; and even, if he could obtain the consent of his wife,
      to embrace a life of celibacy and penance, (tillemont, mem.
      eccles. tom. xiii. p. 890.) the bishop was intimately connected
      with darius, the minister of peace, (id. tom. xiii. p. 928.)]

      the long and narrow tract of the african coast was filled with
      frequent monuments of roman art and magnificence; and the
      respective degrees of improvement might be accurately measured by
      the distance from carthage and the mediterranean. a simple
      reflection will impress every thinking mind with the clearest
      idea of fertility and cultivation: the country was extremely
      populous; the inhabitants reserved a liberal subsistence for
      their own use; and the annual exportation, particularly of wheat,
      was so regular and plentiful, that africa deserved the name of
      the common granary of rome and of mankind. on a sudden the seven
      fruitful provinces, from tangier to tripoli, were overwhelmed by
      the invasion of the vandals; whose destructive rage has perhaps
      been exaggerated by popular animosity, religious zeal, and
      extravagant declamation. war, in its fairest form, implies a
      perpetual violation of humanity and justice; and the hostilities
      of barbarians are inflamed by the fierce and lawless spirit which
      incessantly disturbs their peaceful and domestic society. the
      vandals, where they found resistance, seldom gave quarter; and
      the deaths of their valiant countrymen were expiated by the ruin
      of the cities under whose walls they had fallen. careless of the
      distinctions of age, or sex, or rank, they employed every species
      of indignity and torture, to force from the captives a discovery
      of their hidden wealth. the stern policy of genseric justified
      his frequent examples of military execution: he was not always
      the master of his own passions, or of those of his followers; and
      the calamities of war were aggravated by the licentiousness of
      the moors, and the fanaticism of the donatists. yet i shall not
      easily be persuaded, that it was the common practice of the
      vandals to extirpate the olives, and other fruit trees, of a
      country where they intended to settle: nor can i believe that it
      was a usual stratagem to slaughter great numbers of their
      prisoners before the walls of a besieged city, for the sole
      purpose of infecting the air, and producing a pestilence, of
      which they themselves must have been the first victims. 25

      of the truth of facts.]

      the generous mind of count boniface was tortured by the exquisite
      distress of beholding the ruin which he had occasioned, and whose
      rapid progress he was unable to check. after the loss of a battle
      he retired into hippo regius; where he was immediately besieged
      by an enemy, who considered him as the real bulwark of africa.
      the maritime colony of hippo, 26 about two hundred miles westward
      of carthage, had formerly acquired the distinguishing epithet of
      regius, from the residence of numidian kings; and some remains of
      trade and populousness still adhere to the modern city, which is
      known in europe by the corrupted name of bona. the military
      labors, and anxious reflections, of count boniface, were
      alleviated by the edifying conversation of his friend st.
      augustin; 27 till that bishop, the light and pillar of the
      catholic church, was gently released, in the third month of the
      siege, and in the seventy-sixth year of his age, from the actual
      and the impending calamities of his country. the youth of
      augustin had been stained by the vices and errors which he so
      ingenuously confesses; but from the moment of his conversion to
      that of his death, the manners of the bishop of hippo were pure
      and austere: and the most conspicuous of his virtues was an
      ardent zeal against heretics of every denomination; the
      manichans, the donatists, and the pelagians, against whom he
      waged a perpetual controversy. when the city, some months after
      his death, was burnt by the vandals, the library was fortunately
      saved, which contained his voluminous writings; two hundred and
      thirty-two separate books or treatises on theological subjects,
      besides a complete exposition of the psalter and the gospel, and
      a copious magazine of epistles and homilies. 28 according to the
      judgment of the most impartial critics, the superficial learning
      of augustin was confined to the latin language; 29 and his style,
      though sometimes animated by the eloquence of passion, is usually
      clouded by false and affected rhetoric. but he possessed a
      strong, capacious, argumentative mind; he boldly sounded the dark
      abyss of grace, predestination, free will, and original sin; and
      the rigid system of christianity which he framed or restored, 30
      has been entertained, with public applause, and secret
      reluctance, by the latin church. 31

      chapter xxxiii: conquest of africa by the vandals.part ii.

      by the skill of boniface, and perhaps by the ignorance of the
      vandals, the siege of hippo was protracted above fourteen months:
      the sea was continually open; and when the adjacent country had
      been exhausted by irregular rapine, the besiegers themselves were
      compelled by famine to relinquish their enterprise. the
      importance and danger of africa were deeply felt by the regent of
      the west. placidia implored the assistance of her eastern ally;
      and the italian fleet and army were reenforced by asper, who
      sailed from constantinople with a powerful armament. as soon as
      the force of the two empires was united under the command of
      boniface, he boldly marched against the vandals; and the loss of
      a second battle irretrievably decided the fate of africa. he
      embarked with the precipitation of despair; and the people of
      hippo were permitted, with their families and effects, to occupy
      the vacant place of the soldiers, the greatest part of whom were
      either slain or made prisoners by the vandals. the count, whose
      fatal credulity had wounded the vitals of the republic, might
      enter the palace of ravenna with some anxiety, which was soon
      removed by the smiles of placidia. boniface accepted with
      gratitude the rank of patrician, and the dignity of
      master-general of the roman armies; but he must have blushed at
      the sight of those medals, in which he was represented with the
      name and attributes of victory. 32 the discovery of his fraud,
      the displeasure of the empress, and the distinguished favor of
      his rival, exasperated the haughty and perfidious soul of tius.
      he hastily returned from gaul to italy, with a retinue, or rather
      with an army, of barbarian followers; and such was the weakness
      of the government, that the two generals decided their private
      quarrel in a bloody battle. boniface was successful; but he
      received in the conflict a mortal wound from the spear of his
      adversary, of which he expired within a few days, in such
      christian and charitable sentiments, that he exhorted his wife, a
      rich heiress of spain, to accept tius for her second husband.
      but tius could not derive any immediate advantage from the
      generosity of his dying enemy: he was proclaimed a rebel by the
      justice of placidia; and though he attempted to defend some
      strong fortresses, erected on his patrimonial estate, the
      imperial power soon compelled him to retire into pannonia, to the
      tents of his faithful huns. the republic was deprived, by their
      mutual discord, of the service of her two most illustrious
      champions. 33

      expression of the latter, that tius, the day before, had
      provided himself with a longer spear, implies something like a
      regular duel.]

      it might naturally be expected, after the retreat of boniface,
      that the vandals would achieve, without resistance or delay, the
      conquest of africa. eight years, however, elapsed, from the
      evacuation of hippo to the reduction of carthage. in the midst of
      that interval, the ambitious genseric, in the full tide of
      apparent prosperity, negotiated a treaty of peace, by which he
      gave his son hunneric for a hostage; and consented to leave the
      western emperor in the undisturbed possession of the three
      mauritanias. 34 this moderation, which cannot be imputed to the
      justice, must be ascribed to the policy, of the conqueror.

      his throne was encompassed with domestic enemies, who accused the
      baseness of his birth, and asserted the legitimate claims of his
      nephews, the sons of gonderic. those nephews, indeed, he
      sacrificed to his safety; and their mother, the widow of the
      deceased king, was precipitated, by his order, into the river
      ampsaga. but the public discontent burst forth in dangerous and
      frequent conspiracies; and the warlike tyrant is supposed to have
      shed more vandal blood by the hand of the executioner, than in
      the field of battle. 35 the convulsions of africa, which had
      favored his attack, opposed the firm establishment of his power;
      and the various seditions of the moors and germans, the donatists
      and catholics, continually disturbed, or threatened, the
      unsettled reign of the conqueror. as he advanced towards
      carthage, he was forced to withdraw his troops from the western
      provinces; the sea-coast was exposed to the naval enterprises of
      the romans of spain and italy; and, in the heart of numidia, the
      strong inland city of corta still persisted in obstinate
      independence. 36 these difficulties were gradually subdued by the
      spirit, the perseverance, and the cruelty of genseric; who
      alternately applied the arts of peace and war to the
      establishment of his african kingdom. he subscribed a solemn
      treaty, with the hope of deriving some advantage from the term of
      its continuance, and the moment of its violation. the vigilance
      of his enemies was relaxed by the protestations of friendship,
      which concealed his hostile approach; and carthage was at length
      surprised by the vandals, five hundred and eighty-five years
      after the destruction of the city and republic by the younger
      scipio. 37

      a new city had arisen from its ruins, with the title of a colony;
      and though carthage might yield to the royal prerogatives of
      constantinople, and perhaps to the trade of alexandria, or the
      splendor of antioch, she still maintained the second rank in the
      west; as the rome (if we may use the style of contemporaries) of
      the african world. that wealthy and opulent metropolis 38
      displayed, in a dependent condition, the image of a flourishing
      republic. carthage contained the manufactures, the arms, and the
      treasures of the six provinces. a regular subordination of civil
      honors gradually ascended from the procurators of the streets and
      quarters of the city, to the tribunal of the supreme magistrate,
      who, with the title of proconsul, represented the state and
      dignity of a consul of ancient rome. schools and gymnasia were
      instituted for the education of the african youth; and the
      liberal arts and manners, grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy, were
      publicly taught in the greek and latin languages. the buildings
      of carthage were uniform and magnificent; a shady grove was
      planted in the midst of the capital; the new port, a secure and
      capacious harbor, was subservient to the commercial industry of
      citizens and strangers; and the splendid games of the circus and
      theatre were exhibited almost in the presence of the barbarians.
      the reputation of the carthaginians was not equal to that of
      their country, and the reproach of punic faith still adhered to
      their subtle and faithless character. 39 the habits of trade, and
      the abuse of luxury, had corrupted their manners; but their
      impious contempt of monks, and the shameless practice of
      unnatural lusts, are the two abominations which excite the pious
      vehemence of salvian, the preacher of the age. 40 the king of the
      vandals severely reformed the vices of a voluptuous people; and
      the ancient, noble, ingenuous freedom of carthage (these
      expressions of victor are not without energy) was reduced by
      genseric into a state of ignominious servitude. after he had
      permitted his licentious troops to satiate their rage and
      avarice, he instituted a more regular system of rapine and
      oppression. an edict was promulgated, which enjoined all persons,
      without fraud or delay, to deliver their gold, silver, jewels,
      and valuable furniture or apparel, to the royal officers; and the
      attempt to secrete any part of their patrimony was inexorably
      punished with death and torture, as an act of treason against the
      state. the lands of the proconsular province, which formed the
      immediate district of carthage, were accurately measured, and
      divided among the barbarians; and the conqueror reserved for his
      peculiar domain the fertile territory of byzacium, and the
      adjacent parts of numidia and getulia. 41

      it was natural enough that genseric should hate those whom he had
      injured: the nobility and senators of carthage were exposed to
      his jealousy and resentment; and all those who refused the
      ignominious terms, which their honor and religion forbade them to
      accept, were compelled by the arian tyrant to embrace the
      condition of perpetual banishment. rome, italy, and the provinces
      of the east, were filled with a crowd of exiles, of fugitives,
      and of ingenuous captives, who solicited the public compassion;
      and the benevolent epistles of theodoret still preserve the
      names and misfortunes of clestian and maria. 42 the syrian
      bishop deplores the misfortunes of clestian, who, from the
      state of a noble and opulent senator of carthage, was reduced,
      with his wife and family, and servants, to beg his bread in a
      foreign country; but he applauds the resignation of the christian
      exile, and the philosophic temper, which, under the pressure of
      such calamities, could enjoy more real happiness than was the
      ordinary lot of wealth and prosperity. the story of maria, the
      daughter of the magnificent eudaemon, is singular and
      interesting. in the sack of carthage, she was purchased from the
      vandals by some merchants of syria, who afterwards sold her as a
      slave in their native country. a female attendant, transported in
      the same ship, and sold in the same family, still continued to
      respect a mistress whom fortune had reduced to the common level
      of servitude; and the daughter of eudaemon received from her
      grateful affection the domestic services which she had once
      required from her obedience. this remarkable behavior divulged
      the real condition of maria, who, in the absence of the bishop of
      cyrrhus, was redeemed from slavery by the generosity of some
      soldiers of the garrison. the liberality of theodoret provided
      for her decent maintenance; and she passed ten months among the
      deaconesses of the church; till she was unexpectedly informed,
      that her father, who had escaped from the ruin of carthage,
      exercised an honorable office in one of the western provinces.
      her filial impatience was seconded by the pious bishop:
      theodoret, in a letter still extant, recommends maria to the
      bishop of aegae, a maritime city of cilicia, which was
      frequented, during the annual fair, by the vessels of the west;
      most earnestly requesting, that his colleague would use the
      maiden with a tenderness suitable to her birth; and that he would
      intrust her to the care of such faithful merchants, as would
      esteem it a sufficient gain, if they restored a daughter, lost
      beyond all human hope, to the arms of her afflicted parent.

      among the insipid legends of ecclesiastical history, i am tempted
      to distinguish the memorable fable of the seven sleepers; 43
      whose imaginary date corresponds with the reign of the younger
      theodosius, and the conquest of africa by the vandals. 44 when
      the emperor decius persecuted the christians, seven noble youths
      of ephesus concealed themselves in a spacious cavern in the side
      of an adjacent mountain; where they were doomed to perish by the
      tyrant, who gave orders that the entrance should be firmly
      secured by the a pile of huge stones. they immediately fell into
      a deep slumber, which was miraculously prolonged without injuring
      the powers of life, during a period of one hundred and
      eighty-seven years. at the end of that time, the slaves of
      adolius, to whom the inheritance of the mountain had descended,
      removed the stones to supply materials for some rustic edifice:
      the light of the sun darted into the cavern, and the seven
      sleepers were permitted to awake. after a slumber, as they
      thought of a few hours, they were pressed by the calls of hunger;
      and resolved that jamblichus, one of their number, should
      secretly return to the city to purchase bread for the use of his
      companions. the youth (if we may still employ that appellation)
      could no longer recognize the once familiar aspect of his native
      country; and his surprise was increased by the appearance of a
      large cross, triumphantly erected over the principal gate of
      ephesus. his singular dress, and obsolete language, confounded
      the baker, to whom he offered an ancient medal of decius as the
      current coin of the empire; and jamblichus, on the suspicion of a
      secret treasure, was dragged before the judge. their mutual
      inquiries produced the amazing discovery, that two centuries were
      almost elapsed since jamblichus and his friends had escaped from
      the rage of a pagan tyrant. the bishop of ephesus, the clergy,
      the magistrates, the people, and, as it is said, the emperor
      theodosius himself, hastened to visit the cavern of the seven
      sleepers; who bestowed their benediction, related their story,
      and at the same instant peaceably expired. the origin of this
      marvellous fable cannot be ascribed to the pious fraud and
      credulity of the modern greeks, since the authentic tradition may
      be traced within half a century of the supposed miracle. james of
      sarug, a syrian bishop, who was born only two years after the
      death of the younger theodosius, has devoted one of his two
      hundred and thirty homilies to the praise of the young men of
      ephesus. 45 their legend, before the end of the sixth century,
      was translated from the syriac into the latin language, by the
      care of gregory of tours. the hostile communions of the east
      preserve their memory with equal reverence; and their names are
      honorably inscribed in the roman, the abyssinian, and the russian
      calendar. 46 nor has their reputation been confined to the
      christian world. this popular tale, which mahomet might learn
      when he drove his camels to the fairs of syria, is introduced as
      a divine revelation, into the koran. 47 the story of the seven
      sleepers has been adopted and adorned by the nations, from bengal
      to africa, who profess the mahometan religion; 48 and some
      vestiges of a similar tradition have been discovered in the
      remote extremities of scandinavia. 49 this easy and universal
      belief, so expressive of the sense of mankind, may be ascribed to
      the genuine merit of the fable itself. we imperceptibly advance
      from youth to age, without observing the gradual, but incessant,
      change of human affairs; and even in our larger experience of
      history, the imagination is accustomed, by a perpetual series of
      causes and effects, to unite the most distant revolutions. but if
      the interval between two memorable eras could be instantly
      annihilated; if it were possible, after a momentary slumber of
      two hundred years, to display the new world to the eyes of a
      spectator, who still retained a lively and recent impression of
      the old, his surprise and his reflections would furnish the
      pleasing subject of a philosophical romance. the scene could not
      be more advantageously placed, than in the two centuries which
      elapsed between the reigns of decius and of theodosius the
      younger. during this period, the seat of government had been
      transported from rome to a new city on the banks of the thracian
      bosphorus; and the abuse of military spirit had been suppressed
      by an artificial system of tame and ceremonious servitude. the
      throne of the persecuting decius was filled by a succession of
      christian and orthodox princes, who had extirpated the fabulous
      gods of antiquity: and the public devotion of the age was
      impatient to exalt the saints and martyrs of the catholic church,
      on the altars of diana and hercules. the union of the roman
      empire was dissolved; its genius was humbled in the dust; and
      armies of unknown barbarians, issuing from the frozen regions of
      the north, had established their victorious reign over the
      fairest provinces of europe and africa.

     empire of the east.

      the western world was oppressed by the goths and vandals, who
      fled before the huns; but the achievements of the huns themselves
      were not adequate to their power and prosperity. their victorious
      hordes had spread from the volga to the danube; but the public
      force was exhausted by the discord of independent chieftains;
      their valor was idly consumed in obscure and predatory
      excursions; and they often degraded their national dignity, by
      condescending, for the hopes of spoil, to enlist under the
      banners of their fugitive enemies. in the reign of attila, 1 the
      huns again became the terror of the world; and i shall now
      describe the character and actions of that formidable barbarian;
      who alternately insulted and invaded the east and the west, and
      urged the rapid downfall of the roman empire.

      was one hundred and twenty years of age. thewrocz chron. c. i. p.

      in the tide of emigration which impetuously rolled from the
      confines of china to those of germany, the most powerful and
      populous tribes may commonly be found on the verge of the roman
      provinces. the accumulated weight was sustained for a while by
      artificial barriers; and the easy condescension of the emperors
      invited, without satisfying, the insolent demands of the
      barbarians, who had acquired an eager appetite for the luxuries
      of civilized life. the hungarians, who ambitiously insert the
      name of attila among their native kings, may affirm with truth
      that the hordes, which were subject to his uncle roas, or
      rugilas, had formed their encampments within the limits of modern
      hungary, 2 in a fertile country, which liberally supplied the
      wants of a nation of hunters and shepherds. in this advantageous
      situation, rugilas, and his valiant brothers, who continually
      added to their power and reputation, commanded the alternative of
      peace or war with the two empires. his alliance with the romans
      of the west was cemented by his personal friendship for the great
      tius; who was always secure of finding, in the barbarian camp,
      a hospitable reception and a powerful support. at his
      solicitation, and in the name of john the usurper, sixty thousand
      huns advanced to the confines of italy; their march and their
      retreat were alike expensive to the state; and the grateful
      policy of tius abandoned the possession of pannonia to his
      faithful confederates. the romans of the east were not less
      apprehensive of the arms of rugilas, which threatened the
      provinces, or even the capital. some ecclesiastical historians
      have destroyed the barbarians with lightning and pestilence; 3
      but theodosius was reduced to the more humble expedient of
      stipulating an annual payment of three hundred and fifty pounds
      of gold, and of disguising this dishonorable tribute by the title
      of general, which the king of the huns condescended to accept.
      the public tranquillity was frequently interrupted by the fierce
      impatience of the barbarians, and the perfidious intrigues of the
      byzantine court. four dependent nations, among whom we may
      distinguish the barbarians, disclaimed the sovereignty of the
      huns; and their revolt was encouraged and protected by a roman
      alliance; till the just claims, and formidable power, of rugilas,
      were effectually urged by the voice of eslaw his ambassador.
      peace was the unanimous wish of the senate: their decree was
      ratified by the emperor; and two ambassadors were named,
      plinthas, a general of scythian extraction, but of consular rank;
      and the quaestor epigenes, a wise and experienced statesman, who
      was recommended to that office by his ambitious colleague.

      immediate and genuine ancestors of the modern hungarians, whose
      connection with the two former is extremely faint and remote. the

      adopted by schlozer, belnay, and dankowsky, ascribes them, from
      their language, to the finnish race. fessler, in his history of
      hungary, agrees with gibbon in supposing them turks. mailath has

      the death of rugilas suspended the progress of the treaty. his
      two nephews, attila and bleda, who succeeded to the throne of
      their uncle, consented to a personal interview with the
      ambassadors of constantinople; but as they proudly refused to
      dismount, the business was transacted on horseback, in a spacious
      plain near the city of margus, in the upper maesia. the kings of
      the huns assumed the solid benefits, as well as the vain honors,
      of the negotiation. they dictated the conditions of peace, and
      each condition was an insult on the majesty of the empire.
      besides the freedom of a safe and plentiful market on the banks
      of the danube, they required that the annual contribution should
      be augmented from three hundred and fifty to seven hundred pounds
      of gold; that a fine or ransom of eight pieces of gold should be
      paid for every roman captive who had escaped from his barbarian
      master; that the emperor should renounce all treaties and
      engagements with the enemies of the huns; and that all the
      fugitives who had taken refuge in the court or provinces of
      theodosius, should be delivered to the justice of their offended
      sovereign. this justice was rigorously inflicted on some
      unfortunate youths of a royal race. they were crucified on the
      territories of the empire, by the command of attila: and as soon
      as the king of the huns had impressed the romans with the terror
      of his name, he indulged them in a short and arbitrary respite,
      whilst he subdued the rebellious or independent nations of
      scythia and germany. 4

      attila, the son of mundzuk, deduced his noble, perhaps his regal,
      descent 5 from the ancient huns, who had formerly contended with
      the monarchs of china. his features, according to the observation
      of a gothic historian, bore the stamp of his national origin; and
      the portrait of attila exhibits the genuine deformity of a modern
      calmuk; 6 a large head, a swarthy complexion, small, deep-seated
      eyes, a flat nose, a few hairs in the place of a beard, broad
      shoulders, and a short square body, of nervous strength, though
      of a disproportioned form. the haughty step and demeanor of the
      king of the huns expressed the consciousness of his superiority
      above the rest of mankind; and he had a custom of fiercely
      rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the terror which he
      inspired. yet this savage hero was not inaccessible to pity; his
      suppliant enemies might confide in the assurance of peace or
      pardon; and attila was considered by his subjects as a just and
      indulgent master. he delighted in war; but, after he had ascended
      the throne in a mature age, his head, rather than his hand,
      achieved the conquest of the north; and the fame of an
      adventurous soldier was usefully exchanged for that of a prudent
      and successful general. the effects of personal valor are so
      inconsiderable, except in poetry or romance, that victory, even
      among barbarians, must depend on the degree of skill with which
      the passions of the multitude are combined and guided for the
      service of a single man. the scythian conquerors, attila and
      zingis, surpassed their rude countrymen in art rather than in
      courage; and it may be observed that the monarchies, both of the
      huns and of the moguls, were erected by their founders on the
      basis of popular superstition. the miraculous conception, which
      fraud and credulity ascribed to the virgin-mother of zingis,
      raised him above the level of human nature; and the naked
      prophet, who in the name of the deity invested him with the
      empire of the earth, pointed the valor of the moguls with
      irresistible enthusiasm. 7 the religious arts of attila were not
      less skillfully adapted to the character of his age and country.
      it was natural enough that the scythians should adore, with
      peculiar devotion, the god of war; but as they were incapable of
      forming either an abstract idea, or a corporeal representation,
      they worshipped their tutelar deity under the symbol of an iron
      cimeter. 8 one of the shepherds of the huns perceived, that a
      heifer, who was grazing, had wounded herself in the foot, and
      curiously followed the track of the blood, till he discovered,
      among the long grass, the point of an ancient sword, which he dug
      out of the ground and presented to attila. that magnanimous, or
      rather that artful, prince accepted, with pious gratitude, this
      celestial favor; and, as the rightful possessor of the sword of
      mars, asserted his divine and indefeasible claim to the dominion
      of the earth. 9 if the rites of scythia were practised on this
      solemn occasion, a lofty altar, or rather pile of fagots, three
      hundred yards in length and in breadth, was raised in a spacious
      plain; and the sword of mars was placed erect on the summit of
      this rustic altar, which was annually consecrated by the blood of
      sheep, horses, and of the hundredth captive. 10 whether human
      sacrifices formed any part of the worship of attila, or whether
      he propitiated the god of war with the victims which he
      continually offered in the field of battle, the favorite of mars
      soon acquired a sacred character, which rendered his conquests more
      easy and more permanent; and the barbarian princes confessed, in
      the language of devotion or flattery, that they could not presume
      to gaze, with a steady eye, on the divine majesty of the king of
      the huns. 11 his brother bleda, who reigned over a considerable
      part of the nation, was compelled to resign his sceptre and his
      life. yet even this cruel act was attributed to a supernatural
      impulse; and the vigor with which attila wielded the sword of
      mars, convinced the world that it had been reserved alone for his
      invincible arm. 12 but the extent of his empire affords the only
      remaining evidence of the number and importance of his victories;
      and the scythian monarch, however ignorant of the value of
      science and philosophy, might perhaps lament that his illiterate
      subjects were destitute of the art which could perpetuate the
      memory of his exploits.

      if a line of separation were drawn between the civilized and the
      savage climates of the globe; between the inhabitants of cities,
      who cultivated the earth, and the hunters and shepherds, who
      dwelt in tents, attila might aspire to the title of supreme and
      sole monarch of the barbarians. 13 he alone, among the conquerors
      of ancient and modern times, united the two mighty kingdoms of
      germany and scythia; and those vague appellations, when they are
      applied to his reign, may be understood with an ample latitude.
      thuringia, which stretched beyond its actual limits as far as the
      danube, was in the number of his provinces; he interposed, with
      the weight of a powerful neighbor, in the domestic affairs of the
      franks; and one of his lieutenants chastised, and almost
      exterminated, the burgundians of the rhine.

      he subdued the islands of the ocean, the kingdoms of scandinavia,
      encompassed and divided by the waters of the baltic; and the huns
      might derive a tribute of furs from that northern region, which
      has been protected from all other conquerors by the severity of
      the climate, and the courage of the natives. towards the east, it
      is difficult to circumscribe the dominion of attila over the
      scythian deserts; yet we may be assured, that he reigned on the
      banks of the volga; that the king of the huns was dreaded, not
      only as a warrior, but as a magician; 14 that he insulted and
      vanquished the khan of the formidable geougen; and that he sent
      ambassadors to negotiate an equal alliance with the empire of
      china. in the proud review of the nations who acknowledged the
      sovereignty of attila, and who never entertained, during his
      lifetime, the thought of a revolt, the gepidae and the ostrogoths
      were distinguished by their numbers, their bravery, and the
      personal merits of their chiefs. the renowned ardaric, king of
      the gepidae, was the faithful and sagacious counsellor of the
      monarch, who esteemed his intrepid genius, whilst he loved the
      mild and discreet virtues of the noble walamir, king of the
      ostrogoths. the crowd of vulgar kings, the leaders of so many
      martial tribes, who served under the standard of attila, were
      ranged in the submissive order of guards and domestics round the
      person of their master. they watched his nod; they trembled at
      his frown; and at the first signal of his will, they executed,
      without murmur or hesitation, his stern and absolute commands. in
      time of peace, the dependent princes, with their national troops,
      attended the royal camp in regular succession; but when attila
      collected his military force, he was able to bring into the field
      an army of five, or, according to another account, of seven
      hundred thousand barbarians. 15

      the ambassadors of the huns might awaken the attention of
      theodosius, by reminding him that they were his neighbors both in
      europe and asia; since they touched the danube on one hand, and
      reached, with the other, as far as the tanais. in the reign of
      his father arcadius, a band of adventurous huns had ravaged the
      provinces of the east; from whence they brought away rich spoils
      and innumerable captives. 16 they advanced, by a secret path,
      along the shores of the caspian sea; traversed the snowy
      mountains of armenia; passed the tigris, the euphrates, and the
      halys; recruited their weary cavalry with the generous breed of
      cappadocian horses; occupied the hilly country of cilicia, and
      disturbed the festal songs and dances of the citizens of antioch.
      egypt trembled at their approach; and the monks and pilgrims of
      the holy land prepared to escape their fury by a speedy
      embarkation. the memory of this invasion was still recent in the
      minds of the orientals. the subjects of attila might execute,
      with superior forces, the design which these adventurers had so
      boldly attempted; and it soon became the subject of anxious
      conjecture, whether the tempest would fall on the dominions of
      rome, or of persia. some of the great vassals of the king of the
      huns, who were themselves in the rank of powerful princes, had
      been sent to ratify an alliance and society of arms with the
      emperor, or rather with the general of the west. they related,
      during their residence at rome, the circumstances of an
      expedition, which they had lately made into the east. after
      passing a desert and a morass, supposed by the romans to be the
      lake maeotis, they penetrated through the mountains, and arrived,
      at the end of fifteen days march, on the confines of media;
      where they advanced as far as the unknown cities of basic and
      cursic. 1611 they encountered the persian army in the plains of
      media and the air, according to their own expression, was
      darkened by a cloud of arrows. but the huns were obliged to
      retire before the numbers of the enemy. their laborious retreat
      was effected by a different road; they lost the greatest part of
      their booty; and at length returned to the royal camp, with some
      knowledge of the country, and an impatient desire of revenge. in
      the free conversation of the imperial ambassadors, who discussed,
      at the court of attila, the character and designs of their
      formidable enemy, the ministers of constantinople expressed their
      hope, that his strength might be diverted and employed in a long
      and doubtful contest with the princes of the house of sassan. the
      more sagacious italians admonished their eastern brethren of the
      folly and danger of such a hope; and convinced them, that the
      medes and persians were incapable of resisting the arms of the
      huns; and that the easy and important acquisition would exalt the
      pride, as well as power, of the conqueror. instead of contenting
      himself with a moderate contribution, and a military title, which
      equalled him only to the generals of theodosius, attila would
      proceed to impose a disgraceful and intolerable yoke on the necks
      of the prostrate and captive romans, who would then be
      encompassed, on all sides, by the empire of the huns. 17

      while the powers of europe and asia were solicitous to avert the
      impending danger, the alliance of attila maintained the vandals
      in the possession of africa. an enterprise had been concerted
      between the courts of ravenna and constantinople, for the
      recovery of that valuable province; and the ports of sicily were
      already filled with the military and naval forces of theodosius.
      but the subtle genseric, who spread his negotiations round the
      world, prevented their designs, by exciting the king of the huns
      to invade the eastern empire; and a trifling incident soon became
      the motive, or pretence, of a destructive war. 18 under the faith
      of the treaty of margus, a free market was held on the northern
      side of the danube, which was protected by a roman fortress
      surnamed constantia. a troop of barbarians violated the
      commercial security; killed, or dispersed, the unsuspecting
      traders; and levelled the fortress with the ground. the huns
      justified this outrage as an act of reprisal; alleged, that the
      bishop of margus had entered their territories, to discover and
      steal a secret treasure of their kings; and sternly demanded the
      guilty prelate, the sacrilegious spoil, and the fugitive
      subjects, who had escaped from the justice of attila. the refusal
      of the byzantine court was the signal of war; and the maesians at
      first applauded the generous firmness of their sovereign. but
      they were soon intimidated by the destruction of viminiacum and
      the adjacent towns; and the people was persuaded to adopt the
      convenient maxim, that a private citizen, however innocent or
      respectable, may be justly sacrificed to the safety of his
      country. the bishop of margus, who did not possess the spirit of
      a martyr, resolved to prevent the designs which he suspected. he
      boldly treated with the princes of the huns: secured, by solemn
      oaths, his pardon and reward; posted a numerous detachment of
      barbarians, in silent ambush, on the banks of the danube; and, at
      the appointed hour, opened, with his own hand, the gates of his
      episcopal city. this advantage, which had been obtained by
      treachery, served as a prelude to more honorable and decisive
      victories. the illyrian frontier was covered by a line of castles
      and fortresses; and though the greatest part of them consisted
      only of a single tower, with a small garrison, they were commonly
      sufficient to repel, or to intercept, the inroads of an enemy,
      who was ignorant of the art, and impatient of the delay, of a
      regular siege. but these slight obstacles were instantly swept
      away by the inundation of the huns. 19 they destroyed, with fire
      and sword, the populous cities of sirmium and singidunum, of
      ratiaria and marcianopolis, of naissus and sardica; where every
      circumstance of the discipline of the people, and the
      construction of the buildings, had been gradually adapted to the
      sole purpose of defence. the whole breadth of europe, as it
      extends above five hundred miles from the euxine to the
      hadriatic, was at once invaded, and occupied, and desolated, by
      the myriads of barbarians whom attila led into the field. the
      public danger and distress could not, however, provoke theodosius
      to interrupt his amusements and devotion, or to appear in person
      at the head of the roman legions. but the troops, which had been
      sent against genseric, were hastily recalled from sicily; the
      garrisons, on the side of persia, were exhausted; and a military
      force was collected in europe, formidable by their arms and
      numbers, if the generals had understood the science of command,
      and the soldiers the duty of obedience. the armies of the eastern
      empire were vanquished in three successive engagements; and the
      progress of attila may be traced by the fields of battle.

      the two former, on the banks of the utus, and under the walls of
      marcianopolis, were fought in the extensive plains between the
      danube and mount haemus. as the romans were pressed by a
      victorious enemy, they gradually, and unskilfully, retired
      towards the chersonesus of thrace; and that narrow peninsula, the
      last extremity of the land, was marked by their third, and
      irreparable, defeat. by the destruction of this army, attila
      acquired the indisputable possession of the field. from the
      hellespont to thermopylae, and the suburbs of constantinople, he
      ravaged, without resistance, and without mercy, the provinces of
      thrace and macedonia. heraclea and hadrianople might, perhaps,
      escape this dreadful irruption of the huns; but the words, the
      most expressive of total extirpation and erasure, are applied to
      the calamities which they inflicted on seventy cities of the
      eastern empire. 20 theodosius, his court, and the unwarlike
      people, were protected by the walls of constantinople; but those
      walls had been shaken by a recent earthquake, and the fall of
      fifty-eight towers had opened a large and tremendous breach. the
      damage indeed was speedily repaired; but this accident was
      aggravated by a superstitious fear, that heaven itself had
      delivered the imperial city to the shepherds of scythia, who were
      strangers to the laws, the language, and the religion, of the
      romans. 21

      in all their invasions of the civilized empires of the south, the
      scythian shepherds have been uniformly actuated by a savage and
      destructive spirit. the laws of war, that restrain the exercise
      of national rapine and murder, are founded on two principles of
      substantial interest: the knowledge of the permanent benefits
      which may be obtained by a moderate use of conquest; and a just
      apprehension, lest the desolation which we inflict on the enemys
      country may be retaliated on our own. but these considerations of
      hope and fear are almost unknown in the pastoral state of
      nations. the huns of attila may, without injustice, be compared
      to the moguls and tartars, before their primitive manners were
      changed by religion and luxury; and the evidence of oriental
      history may reflect some light on the short and imperfect annals
      of rome. after the moguls had subdued the northern provinces of
      china, it was seriously proposed, not in the hour of victory and
      passion, but in calm deliberate council, to exterminate all the
      inhabitants of that populous country, that the vacant land might
      be converted to the pasture of cattle. the firmness of a chinese
      mandarin, 22 who insinuated some principles of rational policy
      into the mind of zingis, diverted him from the execution of this
      horrid design. but in the cities of asia, which yielded to the
      moguls, the inhuman abuse of the rights of war was exercised with
      a regular form of discipline, which may, with equal reason,
      though not with equal authority, be imputed to the victorious
      huns. the inhabitants, who had submitted to their discretion,
      were ordered to evacuate their houses, and to assemble in some
      plain adjacent to the city; where a division was made of the
      vanquished into three parts. the first class consisted of the
      soldiers of the garrison, and of the young men capable of bearing
      arms; and their fate was instantly decided: they were either
      enlisted among the moguls, or they were massacred on the spot by
      the troops, who, with pointed spears and bended bows, had formed
      a circle round the captive multitude. the second class, composed
      of the young and beautiful women, of the artificers of every rank
      and profession, and of the more wealthy or honorable citizens,
      from whom a private ransom might be expected, was distributed in
      equal or proportionable lots. the remainder, whose life or death
      was alike useless to the conquerors, were permitted to return to
      the city; which, in the mean while, had been stripped of its
      valuable furniture; and a tax was imposed on those wretched
      inhabitants for the indulgence of breathing their native air.
      such was the behavior of the moguls, when they were not conscious
      of any extraordinary rigor. 23 but the most casual provocation,
      the slightest motive of caprice or convenience, often provoked
      them to involve a whole people in an indiscriminate massacre; and
      the ruin of some flourishing cities was executed with such
      unrelenting perseverance, that, according to their own
      expression, horses might run, without stumbling, over the ground
      where they had once stood. the three great capitals of khorasan,
      maru, neisabour, and herat, were destroyed by the armies of
      zingis; and the exact account which was taken of the slain
      amounted to four millions three hundred and forty-seven thousand
      persons. 24 timur, or tamerlane, was educated in a less barbarous
      age, and in the profession of the mahometan religion; yet, if
      attila equalled the hostile ravages of tamerlane, 25 either the
      tartar or the hun might deserve the epithet of the scourge of

      chapter xxxiv: attila.part ii.

      it may be affirmed, with bolder assurance, that the huns
      depopulated the provinces of the empire, by the number of roman
      subjects whom they led away into captivity. in the hands of a
      wise legislator, such an industrious colony might have
      contributed to diffuse through the deserts of scythia the
      rudiments of the useful and ornamental arts; but these captives,
      who had been taken in war, were accidentally dispersed among the
      hordes that obeyed the empire of attila. the estimate of their
      respective value was formed by the simple judgment of
      unenlightened and unprejudiced barbarians. perhaps they might not
      understand the merit of a theologian, profoundly skilled in the
      controversies of the trinity and the incarnation; yet they
      respected the ministers of every religion; and the active zeal of
      the christian missionaries, without approaching the person or the
      palace of the monarch, successfully labored in the propagation of
      the gospel. 27 the pastoral tribes, who were ignorant of the
      distinction of landed property, must have disregarded the use, as
      well as the abuse, of civil jurisprudence; and the skill of an
      eloquent lawyer could excite only their contempt or their
      abhorrence. 28 the perpetual intercourse of the huns and the
      goths had communicated the familiar knowledge of the two national
      dialects; and the barbarians were ambitious of conversing in
      latin, the military idiom even of the eastern empire. 29 but they
      disdained the language and the sciences of the greeks; and the
      vain sophist, or grave philosopher, who had enjoyed the
      flattering applause of the schools, was mortified to find that
      his robust servant was a captive of more value and importance
      than himself. the mechanic arts were encouraged and esteemed, as
      they tended to satisfy the wants of the huns. an architect in the
      service of onegesius, one of the favorites of attila, was
      employed to construct a bath; but this work was a rare example of
      private luxury; and the trades of the smith, the carpenter, the
      armorer, were much more adapted to supply a wandering people with
      the useful instruments of peace and war. but the merit of the
      physician was received with universal favor and respect: the
      barbarians, who despised death, might be apprehensive of disease;
      and the haughty conqueror trembled in the presence of a captive,
      to whom he ascribed, perhaps, an imaginary power of prolonging or
      preserving his life. 30 the huns might be provoked to insult the
      misery of their slaves, over whom they exercised a despotic
      command; 31 but their manners were not susceptible of a refined
      system of oppression; and the efforts of courage and diligence
      were often recompensed by the gift of freedom. the historian
      priscus, whose embassy is a source of curious instruction, was
      accosted in the camp of attila by a stranger, who saluted him in
      the greek language, but whose dress and figure displayed the
      appearance of a wealthy scythian. in the siege of viminiacum, he
      had lost, according to his own account, his fortune and liberty;
      he became the slave of onegesius; but his faithful services,
      against the romans and the acatzires, had gradually raised him to
      the rank of the native huns; to whom he was attached by the
      domestic pledges of a new wife and several children. the spoils
      of war had restored and improved his private property; he was
      admitted to the table of his former lord; and the apostate greek
      blessed the hour of his captivity, since it had been the
      introduction to a happy and independent state; which he held by
      the honorable tenure of military service. this reflection
      naturally produced a dispute on the advantages and defects of the
      roman government, which was severely arraigned by the apostate,
      and defended by priscus in a prolix and feeble declamation. the
      freedman of onegesius exposed, in true and lively colors, the
      vices of a declining empire, of which he had so long been the
      victim; the cruel absurdity of the roman princes, unable to
      protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to
      trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable
      weight of taxes, rendered still more oppressive by the intricate
      or arbitrary modes of collection; the obscurity of numerous and
      contradictory laws; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial
      proceedings; the partial administration of justice; and the
      universal corruption, which increased the influence of the rich,
      and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor. a sentiment of
      patriotic sympathy was at length revived in the breast of the
      fortunate exile; and he lamented, with a flood of tears, the
      guilt or weakness of those magistrates who had perverted the
      wisest and most salutary institutions. 32

      the timid or selfish policy of the western romans had abandoned
      the eastern empire to the huns. 33 the loss of armies, and the
      want of discipline or virtue, were not supplied by the personal
      character of the monarch. theodosius might still affect the
      style, as well as the title, of invincible augustus; but he was
      reduced to solicit the clemency of attila, who imperiously
      dictated these harsh and humiliating conditions of peace. i. the
      emperor of the east resigned, by an express or tacit convention,
      an extensive and important territory, which stretched along the
      southern banks of the danube, from singidunum, or belgrade, as
      far as novae, in the diocese of thrace. the breadth was defined
      by the vague computation of fifteen 3311 days journey; but, from
      the proposal of attila to remove the situation of the national
      market, it soon appeared, that he comprehended the ruined city of
      naissus within the limits of his dominions. ii. the king of the
      huns required and obtained, that his tribute or subsidy should be
      augmented from seven hundred pounds of gold to the annual sum of
      two thousand one hundred; and he stipulated the immediate payment
      of six thousand pounds of gold, to defray the expenses, or to
      expiate the guilt, of the war. one might imagine, that such a
      demand, which scarcely equalled the measure of private wealth,
      would have been readily discharged by the opulent empire of the
      east; and the public distress affords a remarkable proof of the
      impoverished, or at least of the disorderly, state of the
      finances. a large proportion of the taxes extorted from the
      people was detained and intercepted in their passage, though the
      foulest channels, to the treasury of constantinople. the revenue
      was dissipated by theodosius and his favorites in wasteful and
      profuse luxury; which was disguised by the names of imperial
      magnificence, or christian charity. the immediate supplies had
      been exhausted by the unforeseen necessity of military
      preparations. a personal contribution, rigorously, but
      capriciously, imposed on the members of the senatorian order, was
      the only expedient that could disarm, without loss of time, the
      impatient avarice of attila; and the poverty of the nobles
      compelled them to adopt the scandalous resource of exposing to
      public auction the jewels of their wives, and the hereditary
      ornaments of their palaces. 34 iii. the king of the huns appears
      to have established, as a principle of national jurisprudence,
      that he could never lose the property, which he had once
      acquired, in the persons who had yielded either a voluntary, or
      reluctant, submission to his authority. from this principle he
      concluded, and the conclusions of attila were irrevocable laws,
      that the huns, who had been taken prisoner in war, should be
      released without delay, and without ransom; that every roman
      captive, who had presumed to escape, should purchase his right to
      freedom at the price of twelve pieces of gold; and that all the
      barbarians, who had deserted the standard of attila, should be
      restored, without any promise or stipulation of pardon.

      in the execution of this cruel and ignominious treaty, the
      imperial officers were forced to massacre several loyal and noble
      deserters, who refused to devote themselves to certain death; and
      the romans forfeited all reasonable claims to the friendship of
      any scythian people, by this public confession, that they were
      destitute either of faith, or power, to protect the suppliant,
      who had embraced the throne of theodosius. 35

      1. that attila himself solicited the peace and presents, which he
      had formerly refused; and, 2dly, that, about the same time, the
      ambassadors of india presented a fine large tame tiger to the
      emperor theodosius.]

      the firmness of a single town, so obscure, that, except on this
      occasion, it has never been mentioned by any historian or
      geographer, exposed the disgrace of the emperor and empire.
      azimus, or azimuntium, a small city of thrace on the illyrian
      borders, 36 had been distinguished by the martial spirit of its
      youth, the skill and reputation of the leaders whom they had
      chosen, and their daring exploits against the innumerable host of
      the barbarians. instead of tamely expecting their approach, the
      azimuntines attacked, in frequent and successful sallies, the
      troops of the huns, who gradually declined the dangerous
      neighborhood, rescued from their hands the spoil and the
      captives, and recruited their domestic force by the voluntary
      association of fugitives and deserters. after the conclusion of
      the treaty, attila still menaced the empire with implacable war,
      unless the azimuntines were persuaded, or compelled, to comply
      with the conditions which their sovereign had accepted. the
      ministers of theodosius confessed with shame, and with truth,
      that they no longer possessed any authority over a society of
      men, who so bravely asserted their natural independence; and the
      king of the huns condescended to negotiate an equal exchange with
      the citizens of azimus. they demanded the restitution of some
      shepherds, who, with their cattle, had been accidentally
      surprised. a strict, though fruitless, inquiry was allowed: but
      the huns were obliged to swear, that they did not detain any
      prisoners belonging to the city, before they could recover two
      surviving countrymen, whom the azimuntines had reserved as
      pledges for the safety of their lost companions. attila, on his
      side, was satisfied, and deceived, by their solemn asseveration,
      that the rest of the captives had been put to the sword; and that
      it was their constant practice, immediately to dismiss the romans
      and the deserters, who had obtained the security of the public
      faith. this prudent and officious dissimulation may be condemned,
      or excused, by the casuists, as they incline to the rigid decree
      of st. augustin, or to the milder sentiment of st. jerom and st.
      chrysostom: but every soldier, every statesman, must acknowledge,
      that, if the race of the azimuntines had been encouraged and
      multiplied, the barbarians would have ceased to trample on the
      majesty of the empire. 37

      ii. p. 5-20,) which has been frequently agitated by catholic and
      protestant divines, and even by lawyers and philosophers of every
      age.]

      it would have been strange, indeed, if theodosius had purchased,
      by the loss of honor, a secure and solid tranquillity, or if his
      tameness had not invited the repetition of injuries. the
      byzantine court was insulted by five or six successive embassies;
      38 and the ministers of attila were uniformly instructed to press
      the tardy or imperfect execution of the last treaty; to produce
      the names of fugitives and deserters, who were still protected by
      the empire; and to declare, with seeming moderation, that, unless
      their sovereign obtained complete and immediate satisfaction, it
      would be impossible for him, were it even his wish, to check the
      resentment of his warlike tribes. besides the motives of pride
      and interest, which might prompt the king of the huns to continue
      this train of negotiation, he was influenced by the less
      honorable view of enriching his favorites at the expense of his
      enemies. the imperial treasury was exhausted, to procure the
      friendly offices of the ambassadors and their principal
      attendants, whose favorable report might conduce to the
      maintenance of peace. the barbarian monarch was flattered by the
      liberal reception of his ministers; he computed, with pleasure,
      the value and splendor of their gifts, rigorously exacted the
      performance of every promise which would contribute to their
      private emolument, and treated as an important business of state
      the marriage of his secretary constantius. 39 that gallic
      adventurer, who was recommended by tius to the king of the
      huns, had engaged his service to the ministers of constantinople,
      for the stipulated reward of a wealthy and noble wife; and the
      daughter of count saturninus was chosen to discharge the
      obligations of her country. the reluctance of the victim, some
      domestic troubles, and the unjust confiscation of her fortune,
      cooled the ardor of her interested lover; but he still demanded,
      in the name of attila, an equivalent alliance; and, after many
      ambiguous delays and excuses, the byzantine court was compelled
      to sacrifice to this insolent stranger the widow of armatius,
      whose birth, opulence, and beauty, placed her in the most
      illustrious rank of the roman matrons. for these importunate and
      oppressive embassies, attila claimed a suitable return: he
      weighed, with suspicious pride, the character and station of the
      imperial envoys; but he condescended to promise that he would
      advance as far as sardica to receive any ministers who had been
      invested with the consular dignity. the council of theodosius
      eluded this proposal, by representing the desolate and ruined
      condition of sardica, and even ventured to insinuate that every
      officer of the army or household was qualified to treat with the
      most powerful princes of scythia. maximin, 40 a respectable
      courtier, whose abilities had been long exercised in civil and
      military employments, accepted, with reluctance, the troublesome,
      and perhaps dangerous, commission of reconciling the angry spirit
      of the king of the huns. his friend, the historian priscus, 41
      embraced the opportunity of observing the barbarian hero in the
      peaceful and domestic scenes of life: but the secret of the
      embassy, a fatal and guilty secret, was intrusted only to the
      interpreter vigilius. the two last ambassadors of the huns,
      orestes, a noble subject of the pannonian province, and edecon, a
      valiant chieftain of the tribe of the scyrri, returned at the
      same time from constantinople to the royal camp. their obscure
      names were afterwards illustrated by the extraordinary fortune
      and the contrast of their sons: the two servants of attila became
      the fathers of the last roman emperor of the west, and of the
      first barbarian king of italy.

      the ambassadors, who were followed by a numerous train of men and
      horses, made their first halt at sardica, at the distance of
      three hundred and fifty miles, or thirteen days journey, from
      constantinople. as the remains of sardica were still included
      within the limits of the empire, it was incumbent on the romans
      to exercise the duties of hospitality. they provided, with the
      assistance of the provincials, a sufficient number of sheep and
      oxen, and invited the huns to a splendid, or at least, a
      plentiful supper. but the harmony of the entertainment was soon
      disturbed by mutual prejudice and indiscretion. the greatness of
      the emperor and the empire was warmly maintained by their
      ministers; the huns, with equal ardor, asserted the superiority
      of their victorious monarch: the dispute was inflamed by the rash
      and unseasonable flattery of vigilius, who passionately rejected
      the comparison of a mere mortal with the divine theodosius; and
      it was with extreme difficulty that maximin and priscus were able
      to divert the conversation, or to soothe the angry minds, of the
      barbarians. when they rose from table, the imperial ambassador
      presented edecon and orestes with rich gifts of silk robes and
      indian pearls, which they thankfully accepted. yet orestes could
      not forbear insinuating that he had not always been treated with
      such respect and liberality: and the offensive distinction which
      was implied, between his civil office and the hereditary rank of
      his colleague seems to have made edecon a doubtful friend, and
      orestes an irreconcilable enemy. after this entertainment, they
      travelled about one hundred miles from sardica to naissus. that
      flourishing city, which has given birth to the great constantine,
      was levelled with the ground: the inhabitants were destroyed or
      dispersed; and the appearance of some sick persons, who were
      still permitted to exist among the ruins of the churches, served
      only to increase the horror of the prospect. the surface of the
      country was covered with the bones of the slain; and the
      ambassadors, who directed their course to the north-west, were
      obliged to pass the hills of modern servia, before they descended
      into the flat and marshy grounds which are terminated by the
      danube. the huns were masters of the great river: their
      navigation was performed in large canoes, hollowed out of the
      trunk of a single tree; the ministers of theodosius were safely
      landed on the opposite bank; and their barbarian associates
      immediately hastened to the camp of attila, which was equally
      prepared for the amusements of hunting or of war. no sooner had
      maximin advanced about two miles 4111 from the danube, than he
      began to experience the fastidious insolence of the conqueror. he
      was sternly forbid to pitch his tents in a pleasant valley, lest
      he should infringe the distant awe that was due to the royal
      mansion. 4112 the ministers of attila pressed them to communicate
      the business, and the instructions, which he reserved for the ear
      of their sovereign. when maximin temperately urged the contrary
      practice of nations, he was still more confounded to find that
      the resolutions of the sacred consistory, those secrets (says
      priscus) which should not be revealed to the gods themselves, had
      been treacherously disclosed to the public enemy. on his refusal
      to comply with such ignominious terms, the imperial envoy was
      commanded instantly to depart; the order was recalled; it was
      again repeated; and the huns renewed their ineffectual attempts
      to subdue the patient firmness of maximin. at length, by the
      intercession of scotta, the brother of onegesius, whose
      friendship had been purchased by a liberal gift, he was admitted
      to the royal presence; but, instead of obtaining a decisive
      answer, he was compelled to undertake a remote journey towards
      the north, that attila might enjoy the proud satisfaction of
      receiving, in the same camp, the ambassadors of the eastern and
      western empires. his journey was regulated by the guides, who
      obliged him to halt, to hasten his march, or to deviate from the
      common road, as it best suited the convenience of the king. the
      romans, who traversed the plains of hungary, suppose that they
      passed several navigable rivers, either in canoes or portable
      boats; but there is reason to suspect that the winding stream of
      the teyss, or tibiscus, might present itself in different places
      under different names. from the contiguous villages they received
      a plentiful and regular supply of provisions; mead instead of
      wine, millet in the place of bread, and a certain liquor named
      camus, which according to the report of priscus, was distilled
      from barley. 42 such fare might appear coarse and indelicate to
      men who had tasted the luxury of constantinople; but, in their
      accidental distress, they were relieved by the gentleness and
      hospitality of the same barbarians, so terrible and so merciless
      in war. the ambassadors had encamped on the edge of a large
      morass. a violent tempest of wind and rain, of thunder and
      lightning, overturned their tents, immersed their baggage and
      furniture in the water, and scattered their retinue, who wandered
      in the darkness of the night, uncertain of their road, and
      apprehensive of some unknown danger, till they awakened by their
      cries the inhabitants of a neighboring village, the property of
      the widow of bleda. a bright illumination, and, in a few moments,
      a comfortable fire of reeds, was kindled by their officious
      benevolence; the wants, and even the desires, of the romans were
      liberally satisfied; and they seem to have been embarrassed by
      the singular politeness of bledas widow, who added to her other
      favors the gift, or at least the loan, of a sufficient number of
      beautiful and obsequious damsels. the sunshine of the succeeding
      day was dedicated to repose, to collect and dry the baggage, and
      to the refreshment of the men and horses: but, in the evening,
      before they pursued their journey, the ambassadors expressed
      their gratitude to the bounteous lady of the village, by a very
      acceptable present of silver cups, red fleeces, dried fruits, and
      indian pepper. soon after this adventure, they rejoined the march
      of attila, from whom they had been separated about six days, and
      slowly proceeded to the capital of an empire, which did not
      contain, in the space of several thousand miles, a single city.

      42 (return) [ the huns themselves still continued to despise the
      labors of agriculture: they abused the privilege of a victorious
      nation; and the goths, their industrious subjects, who cultivated
      the earth, dreaded their neighborhood, like that of so many
      ravenous wolves, (priscus, p. 45.) in the same manner the sarts
      and tadgics provide for their own subsistence, and for that of
      the usbec tartars, their lazy and rapacious sovereigns. see
      genealogical history of the tartars, p. 423 455, &c.]

      as far as we may ascertain the vague and obscure geography of
      priscus, this capital appears to have been seated between the
      danube, the teyss, and the carpathian hills, in the plains of
      upper hungary, and most probably in the neighborhood of jezberin,
      agria, or tokay. 43 in its origin it could be no more than an
      accidental camp, which, by the long and frequent residence of
      attila, had insensibly swelled into a huge village, for the
      reception of his court, of the troops who followed his person,
      and of the various multitude of idle or industrious slaves and
      retainers. 44 the baths, constructed by onegesius, were the only
      edifice of stone; the materials had been transported from
      pannonia; and since the adjacent country was destitute even of
      large timber, it may be presumed, that the meaner habitations of
      the royal village consisted of straw, or mud, or of canvass. the
      wooden houses of the more illustrious huns were built and adorned
      with rude magnificence, according to the rank, the fortune, or
      the taste of the proprietors. they seem to have been distributed
      with some degree of order and symmetry; and each spot became more
      honorable as it approached the person of the sovereign. the
      palace of attila, which surpassed all other houses in his
      dominions, was built entirely of wood, and covered an ample space
      of ground. the outward enclosure was a lofty wall, or palisade,
      of smooth square timber, intersected with high towers, but
      intended rather for ornament than defence. this wall, which seems
      to have encircled the declivity of a hill, comprehended a great
      variety of wooden edifices, adapted to the uses of royalty.

      a separate house was assigned to each of the numerous wives of
      attila; and, instead of the rigid and illiberal confinement
      imposed by asiatic jealousy they politely admitted the roman
      ambassadors to their presence, their table, and even to the
      freedom of an innocent embrace. when maximin offered his presents
      to cerca, 4411 the principal queen, he admired the singular
      architecture on her mansion, the height of the round columns, the
      size and beauty of the wood, which was curiously shaped or turned
      or polished or carved; and his attentive eye was able to discover
      some taste in the ornaments and some regularity in the
      proportions. after passing through the guards, who watched before
      the gate, the ambassadors were introduced into the private
      apartment of cerca. the wife of attila received their visit
      sitting, or rather lying, on a soft couch; the floor was covered
      with a carpet; the domestics formed a circle round the queen; and
      her damsels, seated on the ground, were employed in working the
      variegated embroidery which adorned the dress of the barbaric
      warriors. the huns were ambitious of displaying those riches
      which were the fruit and evidence of their victories: the
      trappings of their horses, their swords, and even their shoes,
      were studded with gold and precious stones; and their tables were
      profusely spread with plates, and goblets, and vases of gold and
      silver, which had been fashioned by the labor of grecian artists.

      the monarch alone assumed the superior pride of still adhering to
      the simplicity of his scythian ancestors. 45 the dress of attila,
      his arms, and the furniture of his horse, were plain, without
      ornament, and of a single color. the royal table was served in
      wooden cups and platters; flesh was his only food; and the
      conqueror of the north never tasted the luxury of bread.

      43 (return) [ it is evident that priscus passed the danube and
      the teyss, and that he did not reach the foot of the carpathian
      hills. agria, tokay, and jazberin, are situated in the plains
      circumscribed by this definition. m. de buat (histoire des
      peuples, &c., tom. vii. p. 461) has chosen tokay; otrokosci, (p.
      180, apud mascou, ix. 23,) a learned hungarian, has preferred
      jazberin, a place about thirty-six miles westward of buda and the
      danube. * note: m. st. martin considers the narrative of priscus,
      the only authority of m. de buat and of gibbon, too vague to fix
      the position of attilas camp. it is worthy of remark, that in
      the hungarian traditions collected by thwrocz, l. 2, c. 17,
      precisely on the left branch of the danube, where attilas
      residence was situated, in the same parallel stands the present
      city of buda, in hungarian buduvur. it is for this reason that
      this city has retained for a long time among the germans of
      hungary the name of etzelnburgh or etzela-burgh, i. e., the city
      of attila. the distance of buda from the place where priscus
      crossed the danube, on his way from naissus, is equal to that
      which he traversed to reach the residence of the king of the
      huns. i see no good reason for not acceding to the relations of

      de gengiscan, v. c. 9.]

      when attila first gave audience to the roman ambassadors on the
      banks of the danube, his tent was encompassed with a formidable
      guard. the monarch himself was seated in a wooden chair. his
      stern countenance, angry gestures, and impatient tone, astonished
      the firmness of maximin; but vigilius had more reason to tremble,
      since he distinctly understood the menace, that if attila did not
      respect the law of nations, he would nail the deceitful
      interpreter to the cross. and leave his body to the vultures. the
      barbarian condescended, by producing an accurate list, to expose
      the bold falsehood of vigilius, who had affirmed that no more
      than seventeen deserters could be found. but he arrogantly
      declared, that he apprehended only the disgrace of contending
      with his fugitive slaves; since he despised their impotent
      efforts to defend the provinces which theodosius had intrusted to
      their arms: for what fortress, (added attila,) what city, in
      the wide extent of the roman empire, can hope to exist, secure
      and impregnable, if it is our pleasure that it should be erased
      from the earth? he dismissed, however, the interpreter, who
      returned to constantinople with his peremptory demand of more
      complete restitution, and a more splendid embassy.

      his anger gradually subsided, and his domestic satisfaction in a
      marriage which he celebrated on the road with the daughter of
      eslam, 4511 might perhaps contribute to mollify the native
      fierceness of his temper. the entrance of attila into the royal
      village was marked by a very singular ceremony. a numerous troop
      of women came out to meet their hero and their king. they marched
      before him, distributed into long and regular files; the
      intervals between the files were filled by white veils of thin
      linen, which the women on either side bore aloft in their hands,
      and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins, who
      chanted hymns and songs in the scythian language. the wife of his
      favorite onegesius, with a train of female attendants, saluted
      attila at the door of her own house, on his way to the palace;
      and offered, according to the custom of the country, her
      respectful homage, by entreating him to taste the wine and meat
      which she had prepared for his reception. as soon as the monarch
      had graciously accepted her hospitable gift, his domestics lifted
      a small silver table to a convenient height, as he sat on
      horseback; and attila, when he had touched the goblet with his
      lips, again saluted the wife of onegesius, and continued his
      march. during his residence at the seat of empire, his hours were
      not wasted in the recluse idleness of a seraglio; and the king of
      the huns could maintain his superior dignity, without concealing
      his person from the public view. he frequently assembled his
      council, and gave audience to the ambassadors of the nations; and
      his people might appeal to the supreme tribunal, which he held at
      stated times, and, according to the eastern custom, before the
      principal gate of his wooden palace. the romans, both of the east
      and of the west, were twice invited to the banquets, where attila
      feasted with the princes and nobles of scythia. maximin and his
      colleagues were stopped on the threshold, till they had made a
      devout libation to the health and prosperity of the king of the
      huns; and were conducted, after this ceremony, to their
      respective seats in a spacious hall. the royal table and couch,
      covered with carpets and fine linen, was raised by several steps
      in the midst of the hall; and a son, an uncle, or perhaps a
      favorite king, were admitted to share the simple and homely
      repast of attila. two lines of small tables, each of which
      contained three or four guests, were ranged in order on either
      hand; the right was esteemed the most honorable, but the romans
      ingenuously confess, that they were placed on the left; and that
      beric, an unknown chieftain, most probably of the gothic race,
      preceded the representatives of theodosius and valentinian. the
      barbarian monarch received from his cup-bearer a goblet filled
      with wine, and courteously drank to the health of the most
      distinguished guest; who rose from his seat, and expressed, in
      the same manner, his loyal and respectful vows. this ceremony was
      successively performed for all, or at least for the illustrious
      persons of the assembly; and a considerable time must have been
      consumed, since it was thrice repeated as each course or service
      was placed on the table. but the wine still remained after the
      meat had been removed; and the huns continued to indulge their
      intemperance long after the sober and decent ambassadors of the
      two empires had withdrawn themselves from the nocturnal banquet.
      yet before they retired, they enjoyed a singular opportunity of
      observing the manners of the nation in their convivial
      amusements. two scythians stood before the couch of attila, and
      recited the verses which they had composed, to celebrate his
      valor and his victories. 4512 a profound silence prevailed in the
      hall; and the attention of the guests was captivated by the vocal
      harmony, which revived and perpetuated the memory of their own
      exploits; a martial ardor flashed from the eyes of the warriors,
      who were impatient for battle; and the tears of the old men
      expressed their generous despair, that they could no longer
      partake the danger and glory of the field. 46 this entertainment,
      which might be considered as a school of military virtue, was
      succeeded by a farce, that debased the dignity of human nature. a
      moorish and a scythian buffoon successively excited the mirth of
      the rude spectators, by their deformed figure, ridiculous dress,
      antic gestures, absurd speeches, and the strange, unintelligible
      confusion of the latin, the gothic, and the hunnic languages; and
      the hall resounded with loud and licentious peals of laughter. in
      the midst of this intemperate riot, attila alone, without a
      change of countenance, maintained his steadfast and inflexible
      gravity; which was never relaxed, except on the entrance of
      irnac, the youngest of his sons: he embraced the boy with a smile
      of paternal tenderness, gently pinched him by the cheek, and
      betrayed a partial affection, which was justified by the
      assurance of his prophets, that irnac would be the future support
      of his family and empire. two days afterwards, the ambassadors
      received a second invitation; and they had reason to praise the
      politeness, as well as the hospitality, of attila. the king of
      the huns held a long and familiar conversation with maximin; but
      his civility was interrupted by rude expressions and haughty
      reproaches; and he was provoked, by a motive of interest, to
      support, with unbecoming zeal, the private claims of his
      secretary constantius.

      the emperor (said attila) has long promised him a rich wife:
      constantius must not be disappointed; nor should a roman emperor
      deserve the name of liar. on the third day, the ambassadors were
      dismissed; the freedom of several captives was granted, for a
      moderate ransom, to their pressing entreaties; and, besides the
      royal presents, they were permitted to accept from each of the
      scythian nobles the honorable and useful gift of a horse. maximin
      returned, by the same road, to constantinople; and though he was
      involved in an accidental dispute with beric, the new ambassador
      of attila, he flattered himself that he had contributed, by the
      laborious journey, to confirm the peace and alliance of the two
      nations.

      have introduced an article to determine the sense. nor is it
      quite clear, whether scythian usage is adduced to excuse the
      polygamy, or a marriage, which would be considered incestuous in
      other countries. the latin version has carefully preserved the
      ambiguity, filiam escam uxorem. i am not inclined to construe it

      4512 (return) [ this passage is remarkable from the connection of
      the name of attila with that extraordinary cycle of poetry, which
      is found in different forms in almost all the teutonic
      languages.]

      a latin poem, de prima expeditione attil, regis hunnorum, in
      gallias, was published in the year 1780, by fischer at leipsic.
      it contains, with the continuation, 1452 lines. it abounds in
      metrical faults, but is occasionally not without some rude spirit
      and some copiousness of fancy in the variation of the
      circumstances in the different combats of the hero walther,
      prince of aquitania. it contains little which can be supposed
      historical, and still less which is characteristic concerning
      attila. it relates to a first expedition of attila into europe
      which cannot be traced in history, during which the kings of the
      franks, of the burgundians, and of aquitaine, submit themselves,
      and give hostages to attila: the king of the franks, a personage
      who seems the same with the hagen of teutonic romance; the king
      of burgundy, his daughter heldgund; the king of aquitaine, his
      son walther. the main subject of the poem is the escape of
      walther and heldgund from the camp of attila, and the combat
      between walther and gunthar, king of the franks. with his twelve
      peers, among whom is hagen. walther had been betrayed while he
      passed through worms, the city of the frankish king, by paying
      for his ferry over the rhine with some strange fish, which he had
      caught during his flight, and which were unknown in the waters of
      the rhine. gunthar was desirous of plundering him of the
      treasure, which walther had carried off from the camp of attila.
      the author of this poem is unknown, nor can i, on the vague and
      rather doubtful allusion to thule, as iceland, venture to assign
      its date. it was, evidently, recited in a monastery, as appears
      by the first line; and no doubt composed there. the faults of
      metre would point out a late date; and it may have been formed
      upon some local tradition, as walther, the hero, seems to have
      turned monk.

      this poem, however, in its character and its incidents, bears no
      relation to the teutonic cycle, of which the nibelungen lied is
      the most complete form. in this, in the heldenbuch, in some of
      the danish sagas. in countess lays and ballads in all the
      dialects of scandinavia, appears king etzel (attila) in strife
      with the burgundians and the franks. with these appears, by a
      poetic anachronism, dietrich of berne. (theodoric of verona,) the
      celebrated ostrogothic king; and many other very singular
      coincidences of historic names, which appear in the poems. (see

      i must acknowledge myself unable to form any satisfactory theory
      as to the connection of these poems with the history of the time,
      or the period, from which they may date their origin;
      notwithstanding the laborious investigations and critical
      sagacity of the schlegels, the grimms, of p. e. muller and
      lachman, and a whole host of german critics and antiquaries; not
      to omit our own countryman, mr. herbert, whose theory concerning
      attila is certainly neither deficient in boldness nor
      originality. i conceive the only way to obtain any thing like a
      clear conception on this point would be what lachman has begun,
      (see above,) patiently to collect and compare the various forms
      which the traditions have assumed, without any preconceived,
      either mythical or poetical, theory, and, if possible, to
      discover the original basis of the whole rich and fantastic
      legend. one point, which to me is strongly in favor of the
      antiquity of this poetic cycle, is, that the manners are so
      clearly anterior to chivalry, and to the influence exercised on
      the poetic literature of europe by the chivalrous poems and
      romances. i think i find some traces of that influence in the
      latin poem, though strained through the imagination of a monk.
      the english reader will find an amusing account of the german
      nibelungen and heldenbuch, and of some of the scandinavian sagas,
      in the volume of northern antiquities published by weber, the
      friend of sir walter scott. scott himself contributed a
      considerable, no doubt far the most valuable, part to the work.

      surprise and satisfaction of edecon, when he contemplated the
      splendor of constantinople, had encouraged the interpreter
      vigilius to procure for him a secret interview with the eunuch
      chrysaphius, 48 who governed the emperor and the empire. after
      some previous conversation, and a mutual oath of secrecy, the
      eunuch, who had not, from his own feelings or experience, imbibed
      any exalted notions of ministerial virtue, ventured to propose
      the death of attila, as an important service, by which edecon
      might deserve a liberal share of the wealth and luxury which he
      admired. the ambassador of the huns listened to the tempting
      offer; and professed, with apparent zeal, his ability, as well as
      readiness, to execute the bloody deed; the design was
      communicated to the master of the offices, and the devout
      theodosius consented to the assassination of his invincible
      enemy. but this perfidious conspiracy was defeated by the
      dissimulation, or the repentance, of edecon; and though he might
      exaggerate his inward abhorrence for the treason, which he seemed
      to approve, he dexterously assumed the merit of an early and
      voluntary confession. if we now review the embassy of maximin,
      and the behavior of attila, we must applaud the barbarian, who
      respected the laws of hospitality, and generously entertained and
      dismissed the minister of a prince who had conspired against his
      life. but the rashness of vigilius will appear still more
      extraordinary, since he returned, conscious of his guilt and
      danger, to the royal camp, accompanied by his son, and carrying
      with him a weighty purse of gold, which the favorite eunuch had
      furnished, to satisfy the demands of edecon, and to corrupt the
      fidelity of the guards. the interpreter was instantly seized, and
      dragged before the tribunal of attila, where he asserted his
      innocence with specious firmness, till the threat of inflicting
      instant death on his son extorted from him a sincere discovery of
      the criminal transaction. under the name of ransom, or
      confiscation, the rapacious king of the huns accepted two hundred
      pounds of gold for the life of a traitor, whom he disdained to
      punish. he pointed his just indignation against a nobler object.
      his ambassadors, eslaw and orestes, were immediately despatched
      to constantinople, with a peremptory instruction, which it was
      much safer for them to execute than to disobey. they boldly
      entered the imperial presence, with the fatal purse hanging down
      from the neck of orestes; who interrogated the eunuch
      chrysaphius, as he stood beside the throne, whether he recognized
      the evidence of his guilt. but the office of reproof was reserved
      for the superior dignity of his colleague eslaw, who gravely
      addressed the emperor of the east in the following words:
      theodosius is the son of an illustrious and respectable parent:
      attila likewise is descended from a noble race; and he has
      supported, by his actions, the dignity which he inherited from
      his father mundzuk. but theodosius has forfeited his paternal
      honors, and, by consenting to pay tribute has degraded himself to
      the condition of a slave. it is therefore just, that he should
      reverence the man whom fortune and merit have placed above him;
      instead of attempting, like a wicked slave, clandestinely to
      conspire against his master. the son of arcadius, who was
      accustomed only to the voice of flattery, heard with astonishment
      the severe language of truth: he blushed and trembled; nor did he
      presume directly to refuse the head of chrysaphius, which eslaw
      and orestes were instructed to demand. a solemn embassy, armed
      with full powers and magnificent gifts, was hastily sent to
      deprecate the wrath of attila; and his pride was gratified by the
      choice of nomius and anatolius, two ministers of consular or
      patrician rank, of whom the one was great treasurer, and the
      other was master-general of the armies of the east. he
      condescended to meet these ambassadors on the banks of the river
      drenco; and though he at first affected a stern and haughty
      demeanor, his anger was insensibly mollified by their eloquence
      and liberality. he condescended to pardon the emperor, the
      eunuch, and the interpreter; bound himself by an oath to observe
      the conditions of peace; released a great number of captives;
      abandoned the fugitives and deserters to their fate; and resigned
      a large territory, to the south of the danube, which he had
      already exhausted of its wealth and inhabitants. but this treaty
      was purchased at an expense which might have supported a vigorous
      and successful war; and the subjects of theodosius were compelled
      to redeem the safety of a worthless favorite by oppressive taxes,
      which they would more cheerfully have paid for his destruction.

      attila and the eastern empire must be included within the three
      or four years which are terminated, a.d. 450. by the death of
      theodosius.]

      the emperor theodosius did not long survive the most humiliating
      circumstance of an inglorious life. as he was riding, or hunting,
      in the neighborhood of constantinople, he was thrown from his
      horse into the river lycus: the spine of the back was injured by
      the fall; and he expired some days afterwards, in the fiftieth
      year of his age, and the forty-third of his reign. 50 his sister
      pulcheria, whose authority had been controlled both in civil and
      ecclesiastical affairs by the pernicious influence of the
      eunuchs, was unanimously proclaimed empress of the east; and the
      romans, for the first time, submitted to a female reign. no
      sooner had pulcheria ascended the throne, than she indulged her
      own and the public resentment, by an act of popular justice.
      without any legal trial, the eunuch chrysaphius was executed
      before the gates of the city; and the immense riches which had
      been accumulated by the rapacious favorite, served only to hasten
      and to justify his punishment. 51 amidst the general acclamations
      of the clergy and people, the empress did not forget the
      prejudice and disadvantage to which her sex was exposed; and she
      wisely resolved to prevent their murmurs by the choice of a
      colleague, who would always respect the superior rank and virgin
      chastity of his wife. she gave her hand to marcian, a senator,
      about sixty years of age; and the nominal husband of pulcheria
      was solemnly invested with the imperial purple. the zeal which he
      displayed for the orthodox creed, as it was established by the
      council of chalcedon, would alone have inspired the grateful
      eloquence of the catholics. but the behavior of marcian in a
      private life, and afterwards on the throne, may support a more
      rational belief, that he was qualified to restore and invigorate
      an empire, which had been almost dissolved by the successive
      weakness of two hereditary monarchs. he was born in thrace, and
      educated to the profession of arms; but marcians youth had been
      severely exercised by poverty and misfortune, since his only
      resource, when he first arrived at constantinople, consisted in
      two hundred pieces of gold, which he had borrowed of a friend. he
      passed nineteen years in the domestic and military service of
      aspar, and his son ardaburius; followed those powerful generals
      to the persian and african wars; and obtained, by their
      influence, the honorable rank of tribune and senator. his mild
      disposition, and useful talents, without alarming the jealousy,
      recommended marcian to the esteem and favor of his patrons; he
      had seen, perhaps he had felt, the abuses of a venal and
      oppressive administration; and his own example gave weight and
      energy to the laws, which he promulgated for the reformation of
      manners. 52

     visigoths.attila invades and evacuates italy.the deaths of
     attila, tius, and valentinian the third.

      it was the opinion of marcian, that war should be avoided, as
      long as it is possible to preserve a secure and honorable peace;
      but it was likewise his opinion, that peace cannot be honorable
      or secure, if the sovereign betrays a pusillanimous aversion to
      war. this temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of
      attila, who insolently pressed the payment of the annual tribute.
      the emperor signified to the barbarians, that they must no longer
      insult the majesty of rome by the mention of a tribute; that he
      was disposed to reward, with becoming liberality, the faithful
      friendship of his allies; but that, if they presumed to violate
      the public peace, they should feel that he possessed troops, and
      arms, and resolution, to repel their attacks. the same language,
      even in the camp of the huns, was used by his ambassador
      apollonius, whose bold refusal to deliver the presents, till he
      had been admitted to a personal interview, displayed a sense of
      dignity, and a contempt of danger, which attila was not prepared
      to expect from the degenerate romans. 1 he threatened to chastise
      the rash successor of theodosius; but he hesitated whether he
      should first direct his invincible arms against the eastern or
      the western empire. while mankind awaited his decision with awful
      suspense, he sent an equal defiance to the courts of ravenna and
      constantinople; and his ministers saluted the two emperors with
      the same haughty declaration. attila, my lord, and thy lord,
      commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception. 2
      but as the barbarian despised, or affected to despise, the romans
      of the east, whom he had so often vanquished, he soon declared
      his resolution of suspending the easy conquest, till he had
      achieved a more glorious and important enterprise. in the
      memorable invasions of gaul and italy, the huns were naturally
      attracted by the wealth and fertility of those provinces; but the
      particular motives and provocations of attila can only be
      explained by the state of the western empire under the reign of
      valentinian, or, to speak more correctly, under the
      administration of tius. 3

      bewilders himself in system and conjecture.]

      after the death of his rival boniface, tius had prudently
      retired to the tents of the huns; and he was indebted to their
      alliance for his safety and his restoration. instead of the
      suppliant language of a guilty exile, he solicited his pardon at
      the head of sixty thousand barbarians; and the empress placidia
      confessed, by a feeble resistance, that the condescension, which
      might have been ascribed to clemency, was the effect of weakness
      or fear. she delivered herself, her son valentinian, and the
      western empire, into the hands of an insolent subject; nor could
      placidia protect the son-in-law of boniface, the virtuous and
      faithful sebastian, 4 from the implacable persecution which urged
      him from one kingdom to another, till he miserably perished in
      the service of the vandals. the fortunate tius, who was
      immediately promoted to the rank of patrician, and thrice
      invested with the honors of the consulship, assumed, with the
      title of master of the cavalry and infantry, the whole military
      power of the state; and he is sometimes styled, by contemporary
      writers, the duke, or general, of the romans of the west. his
      prudence, rather than his virtue, engaged him to leave the
      grandson of theodosius in the possession of the purple; and
      valentinian was permitted to enjoy the peace and luxury of italy,
      while the patrician appeared in the glorious light of a hero and
      a patriot, who supported near twenty years the ruins of the
      western empire. the gothic historian ingenuously confesses, that
      tius was born for the salvation of the roman republic; 5 and
      the following portrait, though it is drawn in the fairest colors,
      must be allowed to contain a much larger proportion of truth than
      of flattery. 411 his mother was a wealthy and noble italian, and
      his father gaudentius, who held a distinguished rank in the
      province of scythia, gradually rose from the station of a
      military domestic, to the dignity of master of the cavalry. their
      son, who was enrolled almost in his infancy in the guards, was
      given as a hostage, first to alaric, and afterwards to the huns;
      412 and he successively obtained the civil and military honors of
      the palace, for which he was equally qualified by superior merit.
      the graceful figure of tius was not above the middle stature;
      but his manly limbs were admirably formed for strength, beauty,
      and agility; and he excelled in the martial exercises of managing
      a horse, drawing the bow, and darting the javelin. he could
      patiently endure the want of food, or of sleep; and his mind and
      body were alike capable of the most laborious efforts. he
      possessed the genuine courage that can despise not only dangers,
      but injuries: and it was impossible either to corrupt, or
      deceive, or intimidate the firm integrity of his soul. 6 the
      barbarians, who had seated themselves in the western provinces,
      were insensibly taught to respect the faith and valor of the
      patrician tius. he soothed their passions, consulted their
      prejudices, balanced their interests, and checked their ambition.
      611 a seasonable treaty, which he concluded with genseric,
      protected italy from the depredations of the vandals; the
      independent britons implored and acknowledged his salutary aid;
      the imperial authority was restored and maintained in gaul and
      spain; and he compelled the franks and the suevi, whom he had
      vanquished in the field, to become the useful confederates of the
      republic.

      epithet of proeceps, (sidon. apollinar carmen ix. 181.) his
      adventures in constantinople, in sicily, gaul, spain, and africa,
      are faintly marked in the chronicles of marcellinus and idatius.

      from a principle of interest, as well as gratitude, tius
      assiduously cultivated the alliance of the huns. while he resided
      in their tents as a hostage, or an exile, he had familiarly
      conversed with attila himself, the nephew of his benefactor; and
      the two famous antagonists appeared to have been connected by a
      personal and military friendship, which they afterwards confirmed
      by mutual gifts, frequent embassies, and the education of
      carpilio, the son of tius, in the camp of attila. by the
      specious professions of gratitude and voluntary attachment, the
      patrician might disguise his apprehensions of the scythian
      conqueror, who pressed the two empires with his innumerable
      armies. his demands were obeyed or eluded. when he claimed the
      spoils of a vanquished city, some vases of gold, which had been
      fraudulently embezzled, the civil and military governors of
      noricum were immediately despatched to satisfy his complaints: 7
      and it is evident, from their conversation with maximin and
      priscus, in the royal village, that the valor and prudence of
      tius had not saved the western romans from the common ignominy
      of tribute. yet his dexterous policy prolonged the advantages of
      a salutary peace; and a numerous army of huns and alani, whom he
      had attached to his person, was employed in the defence of gaul.
      two colonies of these barbarians were judiciously fixed in the
      territories of valens and orleans; 8 and their active cavalry
      secured the important passages of the rhone and of the loire.
      these savage allies were not indeed less formidable to the
      subjects than to the enemies of rome. their original settlement
      was enforced with the licentious violence of conquest; and the
      province through which they marched was exposed to all the
      calamities of a hostile invasion. 9 strangers to the emperor or
      the republic, the alani of gaul were devoted to the ambition of
      tius, and though he might suspect, that, in a contest with
      attila himself, they would revolt to the standard of their
      national king, the patrician labored to restrain, rather than to
      excite, their zeal and resentment against the goths, the
      burgundians, and the franks.

      of wallia, the gothic sceptre devolved to theodoric, the son of
      the great alaric; 10 and his prosperous reign of more than thirty
      years, over a turbulent people, may be allowed to prove, that his
      prudence was supported by uncommon vigor, both of mind and body.
      impatient of his narrow limits, theodoric aspired to the
      possession of arles, the wealthy seat of government and commerce;
      but the city was saved by the timely approach of tius; and the
      gothic king, who had raised the siege with some loss and
      disgrace, was persuaded, for an adequate subsidy, to divert the
      martial valor of his subjects in a spanish war. yet theodoric
      still watched, and eagerly seized, the favorable moment of
      renewing his hostile attempts. the goths besieged narbonne, while
      the belgic provinces were invaded by the burgundians; and the
      public safety was threatened on every side by the apparent union
      of the enemies of rome. on every side, the activity of tius,
      and his scythian cavalry, opposed a firm and successful
      resistance. twenty thousand burgundians were slain in battle; and
      the remains of the nation humbly accepted a dependent seat in the
      mountains of savoy. 11 the walls of narbonne had been shaken by
      the battering engines, and the inhabitants had endured the last
      extremities of famine, when count litorius, approaching in
      silence, and directing each horseman to carry behind him two
      sacks of flour, cut his way through the intrenchments of the
      besiegers. the siege was immediately raised; and the more
      decisive victory, which is ascribed to the personal conduct of
      tius himself, was marked with the blood of eight thousand
      goths. but in the absence of the patrician, who was hastily
      summoned to italy by some public or private interest, count
      litorius succeeded to the command; and his presumption soon
      discovered that far different talents are required to lead a wing
      of cavalry, or to direct the operations of an important war. at
      the head of an army of huns, he rashly advanced to the gates of
      thoulouse, full of careless contempt for an enemy whom his
      misfortunes had rendered prudent, and his situation made
      desperate. the predictions of the augurs had inspired litorius
      with the profane confidence that he should enter the gothic
      capital in triumph; and the trust which he reposed in his pagan
      allies, encouraged him to reject the fair conditions of peace,
      which were repeatedly proposed by the bishops in the name of
      theodoric. the king of the goths exhibited in his distress the
      edifying contrast of christian piety and moderation; nor did he
      lay aside his sackcloth and ashes till he was prepared to arm for
      the combat. his soldiers, animated with martial and religious
      enthusiasm, assaulted the camp of litorius. the conflict was
      obstinate; the slaughter was mutual. the roman general, after a
      total defeat, which could be imputed only to his unskilful
      rashness, was actually led through the streets of thoulouse, not
      in his own, but in a hostile triumph; and the misery which he
      experienced, in a long and ignominious captivity, excited the
      compassion of the barbarians themselves. 12 such a loss, in a
      country whose spirit and finances were long since exhausted,
      could not easily be repaired; and the goths, assuming, in their
      turn, the sentiments of ambition and revenge, would have planted
      their victorious standards on the banks of the rhone, if the
      presence of tius had not restored strength and discipline to
      the romans. 13 the two armies expected the signal of a decisive
      action; but the generals, who were conscious of each others
      force, and doubtful of their own superiority, prudently sheathed
      their swords in the field of battle; and their reconciliation was
      permanent and sincere. theodoric, king of the visigoths, appears
      to have deserved the love of his subjects, the confidence of his
      allies, and the esteem of mankind. his throne was surrounded by
      six valiant sons, who were educated with equal care in the
      exercises of the barbarian camp, and in those of the gallic
      schools: from the study of the roman jurisprudence, they acquired
      the theory, at least, of law and justice; and the harmonious
      sense of virgil contributed to soften the asperity of their
      native manners. 14 the two daughters of the gothic king were
      given in marriage to the eldest sons of the kings of the suevi
      and of the vandals, who reigned in spain and africa: but these
      illustrious alliances were pregnant with guilt and discord. the
      queen of the suevi bewailed the death of a husband inhumanly
      massacred by her brother. the princess of the vandals was the
      victim of a jealous tyrant, whom she called her father. the cruel
      genseric suspected that his sons wife had conspired to poison
      him; the supposed crime was punished by the amputation of her
      nose and ears; and the unhappy daughter of theodoric was
      ignominiously returned to the court of thoulouse in that deformed
      and mutilated condition. this horrid act, which must seem
      incredible to a civilized age drew tears from every spectator;
      but theodoric was urged, by the feelings of a parent and a king,
      to revenge such irreparable injuries. the imperial ministers, who
      always cherished the discord of the barbarians, would have
      supplied the goths with arms, and ships, and treasures, for the
      african war; and the cruelty of genseric might have been fatal to
      himself, if the artful vandal had not armed, in his cause, the
      formidable power of the huns. his rich gifts and pressing
      solicitations inflamed the ambition of attila; and the designs of
      tius and theodoric were prevented by the invasion of gaul. 15

      the franks, whose monarchy was still confined to the neighborhood
      of the lower rhine, had wisely established the right of
      hereditary succession in the noble family of the merovingians. 16
      these princes were elevated on a buckler, the symbol of military
      command; 17 and the royal fashion of long hair was the ensign of
      their birth and dignity. their flaxen locks, which they combed
      and dressed with singular care, hung down in flowing ringlets on
      their back and shoulders; while the rest of the nation were
      obliged, either by law or custom, to shave the hinder part of
      their head, to comb their hair over the forehead, and to content
      themselves with the ornament of two small whiskers. 18 the lofty
      stature of the franks, and their blue eyes, denoted a germanic
      origin; their close apparel accurately expressed the figure of
      their limbs; a weighty sword was suspended from a broad belt;
      their bodies were protected by a large shield; and these warlike
      barbarians were trained, from their earliest youth, to run, to
      leap, to swim; to dart the javelin, or battle-axe, with unerring
      aim; to advance, without hesitation, against a superior enemy;
      and to maintain, either in life or death, the invincible
      reputation of their ancestors. 19 clodion, the first of their
      long-haired kings, whose name and actions are mentioned in
      authentic history, held his residence at dispargum, 20 a village
      or fortress, whose place may be assigned between louvain and
      brussels. from the report of his spies, the king of the franks
      was informed, that the defenceless state of the second belgic
      must yield, on the slightest attack, to the valor of his
      subjects. he boldly penetrated through the thickets and morasses
      of the carbonarian forest; 21 occupied tournay and cambray, the
      only cities which existed in the fifth century, and extended his
      conquests as far as the river somme, over a desolate country,
      whose cultivation and populousness are the effects of more recent
      industry. 22 while clodion lay encamped in the plains of artois,
      23 and celebrated, with vain and ostentatious security, the
      marriage, perhaps, of his son, the nuptial feast was interrupted
      by the unexpected and unwelcome presence of tius, who had
      passed the somme at the head of his light cavalry. the tables,
      which had been spread under the shelter of a hill, along the
      banks of a pleasant stream, were rudely overturned; the franks
      were oppressed before they could recover their arms, or their
      ranks; and their unavailing valor was fatal only to themselves.
      the loaded wagons, which had followed their march, afforded a
      rich booty; and the virgin-bride, with her female attendants,
      submitted to the new lovers, who were imposed on them by the
      chance of war. this advance, which had been obtained by the skill
      and activity of tius, might reflect some disgrace on the
      military prudence of clodion; but the king of the franks soon
      regained his strength and reputation, and still maintained the
      possession of his gallic kingdom from the rhine to the somme. 24
      under his reign, and most probably from the enterprising spirit
      of his subjects, his three capitals, mentz, treves, and cologne,
      experienced the effects of hostile cruelty and avarice. the
      distress of cologne was prolonged by the perpetual dominion of
      the same barbarians, who evacuated the ruins of treves; and
      treves, which in the space of forty years had been four times
      besieged and pillaged, was disposed to lose the memory of her
      afflictions in the vain amusements of the circus. 25 the death of
      clodion, after a reign of twenty years, exposed his kingdom to
      the discord and ambition of his two sons. meroveus, the younger,
      26 was persuaded to implore the protection of rome; he was
      received at the imperial court, as the ally of valentinian, and
      the adopted son of the patrician tius; and dismissed to his
      native country, with splendid gifts, and the strongest assurances
      of friendship and support. during his absence, his elder brother
      had solicited, with equal ardor, the formidable aid of attila;
      and the king of the huns embraced an alliance, which facilitated
      the passage of the rhine, and justified, by a specious and
      honorable pretence, the invasion of gaul. 27

      chapter xxxv: invasion by attila.part ii.

      when attila declared his resolution of supporting the cause of
      his allies, the vandals and the franks, at the same time, and
      almost in the spirit of romantic chivalry, the savage monarch
      professed himself the lover and the champion of the princess
      honoria. the sister of valentinian was educated in the palace of
      ravenna; and as her marriage might be productive of some danger
      to the state, she was raised, by the title of augusta, 28 above
      the hopes of the most presumptuous subject. but the fair honoria
      had no sooner attained the sixteenth year of her age, than she
      detested the importunate greatness which must forever exclude her
      from the comforts of honorable love; in the midst of vain and
      unsatisfactory pomp, honoria sighed, yielded to the impulse of
      nature, and threw herself into the arms of her chamberlain
      eugenius. her guilt and shame (such is the absurd language of
      imperious man) were soon betrayed by the appearances of
      pregnancy; but the disgrace of the royal family was published to
      the world by the imprudence of the empress placidia who dismissed
      her daughter, after a strict and shameful confinement, to a
      remote exile at constantinople. the unhappy princess passed
      twelve or fourteen years in the irksome society of the sisters of
      theodosius, and their chosen virgins; to whose crown honoria
      could no longer aspire, and whose monastic assiduity of prayer,
      fasting, and vigils, she reluctantly imitated. her impatience of
      long and hopeless celibacy urged her to embrace a strange and
      desperate resolution. the name of attila was familiar and
      formidable at constantinople; and his frequent embassies
      entertained a perpetual intercourse between his camp and the
      imperial palace. in the pursuit of love, or rather of revenge,
      the daughter of placidia sacrificed every duty and every
      prejudice; and offered to deliver her person into the arms of a
      barbarian, of whose language she was ignorant, whose figure was
      scarcely human, and whose religion and manners she abhorred. by
      the ministry of a faithful eunuch, she transmitted to attila a
      ring, the pledge of her affection; and earnestly conjured him to
      claim her as a lawful spouse, to whom he had been secretly
      betrothed. these indecent advances were received, however, with
      coldness and disdain; and the king of the huns continued to
      multiply the number of his wives, till his love was awakened by
      the more forcible passions of ambition and avarice. the invasion
      of gaul was preceded, and justified, by a formal demand of the
      princess honoria, with a just and equal share of the imperial
      patrimony. his predecessors, the ancient tanjous, had often
      addressed, in the same hostile and peremptory manner, the
      daughters of china; and the pretensions of attila were not less
      offensive to the majesty of rome. a firm, but temperate, refusal
      was communicated to his ambassadors. the right of female
      succession, though it might derive a specious argument from the
      recent examples of placidia and pulcheria, was strenuously
      denied; and the indissoluble engagements of honoria were opposed
      to the claims of her scythian lover. 29 on the discovery of her
      connection with the king of the huns, the guilty princess had
      been sent away, as an object of horror, from constantinople to
      italy: her life was spared; but the ceremony of her marriage was
      performed with some obscure and nominal husband, before she was
      immured in a perpetual prison, to bewail those crimes and
      misfortunes, which honoria might have escaped, had she not been
      born the daughter of an emperor. 30

      her invitation of attila.]

      a native of gaul, and a contemporary, the learned and eloquent
      sidonius, who was afterwards bishop of clermont, had made a
      promise to one of his friends, that he would compose a regular
      history of the war of attila. if the modesty of sidonius had not
      discouraged him from the prosecution of this interesting work, 31
      the historian would have related, with the simplicity of truth,
      those memorable events, to which the poet, in vague and doubtful
      metaphors, has concisely alluded. 32 the kings and nations of
      germany and scythia, from the volga perhaps to the danube, obeyed
      the warlike summons of attila. from the royal village, in the
      plains of hungary his standard moved towards the west; and after
      a march of seven or eight hundred miles, he reached the conflux
      of the rhine and the neckar, where he was joined by the franks,
      who adhered to his ally, the elder of the sons of clodion. a
      troop of light barbarians, who roamed in quest of plunder, might
      choose the winter for the convenience of passing the river on the
      ice; but the innumerable cavalry of the huns required such plenty
      of forage and provisions, as could be procured only in a milder
      season; the hercynian forest supplied materials for a bridge of
      boats; and the hostile myriads were poured, with resistless
      violence, into the belgic provinces. 33 the consternation of gaul
      was universal; and the various fortunes of its cities have been
      adorned by tradition with martyrdoms and miracles. 34 troyes was
      saved by the merits of st. lupus; st. servatius was removed from
      the world, that he might not behold the ruin of tongres; and the
      prayers of st. genevieve diverted the march of attila from the
      neighborhood of paris. but as the greatest part of the gallic
      cities were alike destitute of saints and soldiers, they were
      besieged and stormed by the huns; who practised, in the example
      of metz, 35 their customary maxims of war. they involved, in a
      promiscuous massacre, the priests who served at the altar, and
      the infants, who, in the hour of danger, had been providently
      baptized by the bishop; the flourishing city was delivered to the
      flames, and a solitary chapel of st. stephen marked the place
      where it formerly stood. from the rhine and the moselle, attila
      advanced into the heart of gaul; crossed the seine at auxerre;
      and, after a long and laborious march, fixed his camp under the
      walls of orleans. he was desirous of securing his conquests by
      the possession of an advantageous post, which commanded the
      passage of the loire; and he depended on the secret invitation of
      sangiban, king of the alani, who had promised to betray the city,
      and to revolt from the service of the empire. but this
      treacherous conspiracy was detected and disappointed: orleans had
      been strengthened with recent fortifications; and the assaults of
      the huns were vigorously repelled by the faithful valor of the
      soldiers, or citizens, who defended the place. the pastoral
      diligence of anianus, a bishop of primitive sanctity and
      consummate prudence, exhausted every art of religious policy to
      support their courage, till the arrival of the expected succors.
      after an obstinate siege, the walls were shaken by the battering
      rams; the huns had already occupied the suburbs; and the people,
      who were incapable of bearing arms, lay prostrate in prayer.
      anianus, who anxiously counted the days and hours, despatched a
      trusty messenger to observe, from the rampart, the face of the
      distant country. he returned twice, without any intelligence that
      could inspire hope or comfort; but, in his third report, he
      mentioned a small cloud, which he had faintly descried at the
      extremity of the horizon. it is the aid of god! exclaimed the
      bishop, in a tone of pious confidence; and the whole multitude
      repeated after him, it is the aid of god. the remote object, on
      which every eye was fixed, became each moment larger, and more
      distinct; the roman and gothic banners were gradually perceived;
      and a favorable wind blowing aside the dust, discovered, in deep
      array, the impatient squadrons of tius and theodoric, who
      pressed forwards to the relief of orleans.

      the facility with which attila had penetrated into the heart of
      gaul, may be ascribed to his insidious policy, as well as to the
      terror of his arms. his public declarations were skilfully
      mitigated by his private assurances; he alternately soothed and
      threatened the romans and the goths; and the courts of ravenna
      and thoulouse, mutually suspicious of each others intentions,
      beheld, with supine indifference, the approach of their common
      enemy. tius was the sole guardian of the public safety; but his
      wisest measures were embarrassed by a faction, which, since the
      death of placidia, infested the imperial palace: the youth of
      italy trembled at the sound of the trumpet; and the barbarians,
      who, from fear or affection, were inclined to the cause of
      attila, awaited with doubtful and venal faith, the event of the
      war. the patrician passed the alps at the head of some troops,
      whose strength and numbers scarcely deserved the name of an army.
      36 but on his arrival at arles, or lyons, he was confounded by
      the intelligence, that the visigoths, refusing to embrace the
      defence of gaul, had determined to expect, within their own
      territories, the formidable invader, whom they professed to
      despise. the senator avitus, who, after the honorable exercise of
      the prtorian prfecture, had retired to his estate in
      auvergne, was persuaded to accept the important embassy, which he
      executed with ability and success. he represented to theodoric,
      that an ambitious conqueror, who aspired to the dominion of the
      earth, could be resisted only by the firm and unanimous alliance
      of the powers whom he labored to oppress. the lively eloquence of
      avitus inflamed the gothic warriors, by the description of the
      injuries which their ancestors had suffered from the huns; whose
      implacable fury still pursued them from the danube to the foot of
      the pyrenees. he strenuously urged, that it was the duty of every
      christian to save, from sacrilegious violation, the churches of
      god, and the relics of the saints: that it was the interest of
      every barbarian, who had acquired a settlement in gaul, to defend
      the fields and vineyards, which were cultivated for his use,
      against the desolation of the scythian shepherds. theodoric
      yielded to the evidence of truth; adopted the measure at once the
      most prudent and the most honorable; and declared, that, as the
      faithful ally of tius and the romans, he was ready to expose
      his life and kingdom for the common safety of gaul. 37 the
      visigoths, who, at that time, were in the mature vigor of their
      fame and power, obeyed with alacrity the signal of war; prepared
      their arms and horses, and assembled under the standard of their
      aged king, who was resolved, with his two eldest sons, torismond
      and theodoric, to command in person his numerous and valiant
      people. the example of the goths determined several tribes or
      nations, that seemed to fluctuate between the huns and the
      romans. the indefatigable diligence of the patrician gradually
      collected the troops of gaul and germany, who had formerly
      acknowledged themselves the subjects, or soldiers, of the
      republic, but who now claimed the rewards of voluntary service,
      and the rank of independent allies; the lti, the armoricans,
      the breones, the saxons, the burgundians, the sarmatians, or
      alani, the ripuarians, and the franks who followed meroveus as
      their lawful prince. such was the various army, which, under the
      conduct of tius and theodoric, advanced, by rapid marches to
      relieve orleans, and to give battle to the innumerable host of
      attila. 38

      the loeti were a promiscuous race of barbarians, born or
      naturalized in gaul; and the riparii, or ripuarii, derived their
      name from their post on the three rivers, the rhine, the meuse,
      and the moselle; the armoricans possessed the independent cities
      between the seine and the loire. a colony of saxons had been
      planted in the diocese of bayeux; the burgundians were settled in
      savoy; and the breones were a warlike tribe of rhaetians, to the
      east of the lake of constance.]

      on their approach the king of the huns immediately raised the
      siege, and sounded a retreat to recall the foremost of his troops
      from the pillage of a city which they had already entered. 39 the
      valor of attila was always guided by his prudence; and as he
      foresaw the fatal consequences of a defeat in the heart of gaul,
      he repassed the seine, and expected the enemy in the plains of
      chalons, whose smooth and level surface was adapted to the
      operations of his scythian cavalry. but in this tumultuary
      retreat, the vanguard of the romans and their allies continually
      pressed, and sometimes engaged, the troops whom attila had posted
      in the rear; the hostile columns, in the darkness of the night
      and the perplexity of the roads, might encounter each other
      without design; and the bloody conflict of the franks and
      gepidae, in which fifteen thousand 40 barbarians were slain, was
      a prelude to a more general and decisive action. the catalaunian
      fields 41 spread themselves round chalons, and extend, according
      to the vague measurement of jornandes, to the length of one
      hundred and fifty, and the breadth of one hundred miles, over the
      whole province, which is entitled to the appellation of a
      champaign country. 42 this spacious plain was distinguished,
      however, by some inequalities of ground; and the importance of a
      height, which commanded the camp of attila, was understood and
      disputed by the two generals. the young and valiant torismond
      first occupied the summit; the goths rushed with irresistible
      weight on the huns, who labored to ascend from the opposite side:
      and the possession of this advantageous post inspired both the
      troops and their leaders with a fair assurance of victory. the
      anxiety of attila prompted him to consult his priests and
      haruspices. it was reported, that, after scrutinizing the
      entrails of victims, and scraping their bones, they revealed, in
      mysterious language, his own defeat, with the death of his
      principal adversary; and that the barbarians, by accepting the
      equivalent, expressed his involuntary esteem for the superior
      merit of tius. but the unusual despondency, which seemed to
      prevail among the huns, engaged attila to use the expedient, so
      familiar to the generals of antiquity, of animating his troops by
      a military oration; and his language was that of a king, who had
      often fought and conquered at their head. 43 he pressed them to
      consider their past glory, their actual danger, and their future
      hopes. the same fortune, which opened the deserts and morasses of
      scythia to their unarmed valor, which had laid so many warlike
      nations prostrate at their feet, had reserved the joys of this
      memorable field for the consummation of their victories. the
      cautious steps of their enemies, their strict alliance, and their
      advantageous posts, he artfully represented as the effects, not
      of prudence, but of fear. the visigoths alone were the strength
      and nerves of the opposite army; and the huns might securely
      trample on the degenerate romans, whose close and compact order
      betrayed their apprehensions, and who were equally incapable of
      supporting the dangers or the fatigues of a day of battle. the
      doctrine of predestination, so favorable to martial virtue, was
      carefully inculcated by the king of the huns; who assured his
      subjects, that the warriors, protected by heaven, were safe and
      invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy; but that the unerring
      fates would strike their victims in the bosom of inglorious
      peace. i myself, continued attila, will throw the first
      javelin, and the wretch who refuses to imitate the example of his
      sovereign, is devoted to inevitable death. the spirit of the
      barbarians was rekindled by the presence, the voice, and the
      example of their intrepid leader; and attila, yielding to their
      impatience, immediately formed his order of battle. at the head
      of his brave and faithful huns, he occupied in person the centre
      of the line. the nations subject to his empire, the rugians, the
      heruli, the thuringians, the franks, the burgundians, were
      extended on either hand, over the ample space of the catalaunian
      fields; the right wing was commanded by ardaric, king of the
      gepidae; and the three valiant brothers, who reigned over the
      ostrogoths, were posted on the left to oppose the kindred tribes
      of the visigoths. the disposition of the allies was regulated by
      a different principle. sangiban, the faithless king of the alani,
      was placed in the centre, where his motions might be strictly
      watched, and that the treachery might be instantly punished.
      tius assumed the command of the left, and theodoric of the
      right wing; while torismond still continued to occupy the heights
      which appear to have stretched on the flank, and perhaps the
      rear, of the scythian army. the nations from the volga to the
      atlantic were assembled on the plain of chalons; but many of
      these nations had been divided by faction, or conquest, or
      emigration; and the appearance of similar arms and ensigns, which
      threatened each other, presented the image of a civil war.

      original scythian cast; and i doubt, whether an italian of the
      sixth century would have thought of the hujus certaminis gaudia.]

      the discipline and tactics of the greeks and romans form an
      interesting part of their national manners. the attentive study
      of the military operations of xenophon, or caesar, or frederic,
      when they are described by the same genius which conceived and
      executed them, may tend to improve (if such improvement can be
      wished) the art of destroying the human species. but the battle
      of chalons can only excite our curiosity by the magnitude of the
      object; since it was decided by the blind impetuosity of
      barbarians, and has been related by partial writers, whose civil
      or ecclesiastical profession secluded them from the knowledge of
      military affairs. cassiolorus, however, had familiarly conversed
      with many gothic warriors, who served in that memorable
      engagement; a conflict, as they informed him, fierce, various,
      obstinate, and bloody; such as could not be paralleled either in
      the present or in past ages. the number of the slain amounted to
      one hundred and sixty-two thousand, or, according to another
      account, three hundred thousand persons; 44 and these incredible
      exaggerations suppose a real and effective loss sufficient to
      justify the historians remark, that whole generations may be
      swept away by the madness of kings, in the space of a single
      hour. after the mutual and repeated discharge of missile weapons,
      in which the archers of scythia might signalize their superior
      dexterity, the cavalry and infantry of the two armies were
      furiously mingled in closer combat. the huns, who fought under
      the eyes of their king pierced through the feeble and doubtful
      centre of the allies, separated their wings from each other, and
      wheeling, with a rapid effort, to the left, directed their whole
      force against the visigoths. as theodoric rode along the ranks,
      to animate his troops, he received a mortal stroke from the
      javelin of andages, a noble ostrogoth, and immediately fell from
      his horse. the wounded king was oppressed in the general
      disorder, and trampled under the feet of his own cavalry; and
      this important death served to explain the ambiguous prophecy of
      the haruspices. attila already exulted in the confidence of
      victory, when the valiant torismond descended from the hills, and
      verified the remainder of the prediction. the visigoths, who had
      been thrown into confusion by the flight or defection of the
      alani, gradually restored their order of battle; and the huns
      were undoubtedly vanquished, since attila was compelled to
      retreat. he had exposed his person with the rashness of a private
      soldier; but the intrepid troops of the centre had pushed
      forwards beyond the rest of the line; their attack was faintly
      supported; their flanks were unguarded; and the conquerors of
      scythia and germany were saved by the approach of the night from
      a total defeat. they retired within the circle of wagons that
      fortified their camp; and the dismounted squadrons prepared
      themselves for a defence, to which neither their arms, nor their
      temper, were adapted. the event was doubtful: but attila had
      secured a last and honorable resource. the saddles and rich
      furniture of the cavalry were collected, by his order, into a
      funeral pile; and the magnanimous barbarian had resolved, if his
      intrenchments should be forced, to rush headlong into the flames,
      and to deprive his enemies of the glory which they might have
      acquired, by the death or captivity of attila. 45

      revenged.]

      but his enemies had passed the night in equal disorder and
      anxiety. the inconsiderate courage of torismond was tempted to
      urge the pursuit, till he unexpectedly found himself, with a few
      followers, in the midst of the scythian wagons. in the confusion
      of a nocturnal combat, he was thrown from his horse; and the
      gothic prince must have perished like his father, if his youthful
      strength, and the intrepid zeal of his companions, had not
      rescued him from this dangerous situation. in the same manner,
      but on the left of the line, tius himself, separated from his
      allies, ignorant of their victory, and anxious for their fate,
      encountered and escaped the hostile troops that were scattered
      over the plains of chalons; and at length reached the camp of the
      goths, which he could only fortify with a slight rampart of
      shields, till the dawn of day. the imperial general was soon
      satisfied of the defeat of attila, who still remained inactive
      within his intrenchments; and when he contemplated the bloody
      scene, he observed, with secret satisfaction, that the loss had
      principally fallen on the barbarians. the body of theodoric,
      pierced with honorable wounds, was discovered under a heap of the
      slain: his subjects bewailed the death of their king and father;
      but their tears were mingled with songs and acclamations, and his
      funeral rites were performed in the face of a vanquished enemy.
      the goths, clashing their arms, elevated on a buckler his eldest
      son torismond, to whom they justly ascribed the glory of their
      success; and the new king accepted the obligation of revenge as a
      sacred portion of his paternal inheritance. yet the goths
      themselves were astonished by the fierce and undaunted aspect of
      their formidable antagonist; and their historian has compared
      attila to a lion encompassed in his den, and threatening his
      hunters with redoubled fury. the kings and nations who might have
      deserted his standard in the hour of distress, were made sensible
      that the displeasure of their monarch was the most imminent and
      inevitable danger. all his instruments of martial music
      incessantly sounded a loud and animating strain of defiance; and
      the foremost troops who advanced to the assault were checked or
      destroyed by showers of arrows from every side of the
      intrenchments. it was determined, in a general council of war, to
      besiege the king of the huns in his camp, to intercept his
      provisions, and to reduce him to the alternative of a disgraceful
      treaty or an unequal combat. but the impatience of the barbarians
      soon disdained these cautious and dilatory measures; and the
      mature policy of tius was apprehensive that, after the
      extirpation of the huns, the republic would be oppressed by the
      pride and power of the gothic nation. the patrician exerted the
      superior ascendant of authority and reason to calm the passions,
      which the son of theodoric considered as a duty; represented,
      with seeming affection and real truth, the dangers of absence and
      delay and persuaded torismond to disappoint, by his speedy
      return, the ambitious designs of his brothers, who might occupy
      the throne and treasures of thoulouse. 46 after the departure of
      the goths, and the separation of the allied army, attila was
      surprised at the vast silence that reigned over the plains of
      chalons: the suspicion of some hostile stratagem detained him
      several days within the circle of his wagons, and his retreat
      beyond the rhine confessed the last victory which was achieved in
      the name of the western empire. meroveus and his franks,
      observing a prudent distance, and magnifying the opinion of their
      strength by the numerous fires which they kindled every night,
      continued to follow the rear of the huns till they reached the
      confines of thuringia. the thuringians served in the army of
      attila: they traversed, both in their march and in their return,
      the territories of the franks; and it was perhaps in this war
      that they exercised the cruelties which, about fourscore years
      afterwards, were revenged by the son of clovis. they massacred
      their hostages, as well as their captives: two hundred young
      maidens were tortured with exquisite and unrelenting rage; their
      bodies were torn asunder by wild horses, or their bones were
      crushed under the weight of rolling wagons; and their unburied
      limbs were abandoned on the public roads, as a prey to dogs and
      vultures. such were those savage ancestors, whose imaginary
      virtues have sometimes excited the praise and envy of civilized
      ages. 47

      suggesting to him a similar apprehension. the false idatius
      ridiculously pretends, that tius paid a clandestine nocturnal
      visit to the kings of the huns and of the visigoths; from each of

      chapter xxxv: invasion by attila.part iii.

      neither the spirit, nor the forces, nor the reputation, of
      attila, were impaired by the failure of the gallic expedition. in
      the ensuing spring he repeated his demand of the princess
      honoria, and her patrimonial treasures. the demand was again
      rejected, or eluded; and the indignant lover immediately took the
      field, passed the alps, invaded italy, and besieged aquileia with
      an innumerable host of barbarians. those barbarians were
      unskilled in the methods of conducting a regular siege, which,
      even among the ancients, required some knowledge, or at least
      some practice, of the mechanic arts. but the labor of many
      thousand provincials and captives, whose lives were sacrificed
      without pity, might execute the most painful and dangerous work.
      the skill of the roman artists might be corrupted to the
      destruction of their country. the walls of aquileia were
      assaulted by a formidable train of battering rams, movable
      turrets, and engines, that threw stones, darts, and fire; 48 and
      the monarch of the huns employed the forcible impulse of hope,
      fear, emulation, and interest, to subvert the only barrier which
      delayed the conquest of italy. aquileia was at that period one of
      the richest, the most populous, and the strongest of the maritime
      cities of the adriatic coast. the gothic auxiliaries, who
      appeared to have served under their native princes, alaric and
      antala, communicated their intrepid spirit; and the citizens
      still remembered the glorious and successful resistance which
      their ancestors had opposed to a fierce, inexorable barbarian,
      who disgraced the majesty of the roman purple. three months were
      consumed without effect in the siege of the aquileia; till the
      want of provisions, and the clamors of his army, compelled attila
      to relinquish the enterprise; and reluctantly to issue his
      orders, that the troops should strike their tents the next
      morning, and begin their retreat. but as he rode round the walls,
      pensive, angry, and disappointed, he observed a stork preparing
      to leave her nest, in one of the towers, and to fly with her
      infant family towards the country. he seized, with the ready
      penetration of a statesman, this trifling incident, which chance
      had offered to superstition; and exclaimed, in a loud and
      cheerful tone, that such a domestic bird, so constantly attached
      to human society, would never have abandoned her ancient seats,
      unless those towers had been devoted to impending ruin and
      solitude. 49 the favorable omen inspired an assurance of victory;
      the siege was renewed and prosecuted with fresh vigor; a large
      breach was made in the part of the wall from whence the stork had
      taken her flight; the huns mounted to the assault with
      irresistible fury; and the succeeding generation could scarcely
      discover the ruins of aquileia. 50 after this dreadful
      chastisement, attila pursued his march; and as he passed, the
      cities of altinum, concordia, and padua, were reduced into heaps
      of stones and ashes. the inland towns, vicenza, verona, and
      bergamo, were exposed to the rapacious cruelty of the huns. milan
      and pavia submitted, without resistance, to the loss of their
      wealth; and applauded the unusual clemency which preserved from
      the flames the public, as well as private, buildings, and spared
      the lives of the captive multitude. the popular traditions of
      comum, turin, or modena, may justly be suspected; yet they concur
      with more authentic evidence to prove, that attila spread his
      ravages over the rich plains of modern lombardy; which are
      divided by the po, and bounded by the alps and apennine. 51 when
      he took possession of the royal palace of milan, he was surprised
      and offended at the sight of a picture which represented the
      caesars seated on their throne, and the princes of scythia
      prostrate at their feet. the revenge which attila inflicted on
      this monument of roman vanity, was harmless and ingenious. he
      commanded a painter to reverse the figures and the attitudes; and
      the emperors were delineated on the same canvas, approaching in a
      suppliant posture to empty their bags of tributary gold before
      the throne of the scythian monarch. 52 the spectators must have
      confessed the truth and propriety of the alteration; and were
      perhaps tempted to apply, on this singular occasion, the
      well-known fable of the dispute between the lion and the man. 53

      it is a saying worthy of the ferocious pride of attila, that the
      grass never grew on the spot where his horse had trod. yet the
      savage destroyer undesignedly laid the foundation of a republic,
      which revived, in the feudal state of europe, the art and spirit
      of commercial industry. the celebrated name of venice, or
      venetia, 54 was formerly diffused over a large and fertile
      province of italy, from the confines of pannonia to the river
      addua, and from the po to the rhaetian and julian alps. before
      the irruption of the barbarians, fifty venetian cities flourished
      in peace and prosperity: aquileia was placed in the most
      conspicuous station: but the ancient dignity of padua was
      supported by agriculture and manufactures; and the property of
      five hundred citizens, who were entitled to the equestrian rank,
      must have amounted, at the strictest computation, to one million
      seven hundred thousand pounds. many families of aquileia, padua,
      and the adjacent towns, who fled from the sword of the huns,
      found a safe, though obscure, refuge in the neighboring islands.
      55 at the extremity of the gulf, where the adriatic feebly
      imitates the tides of the ocean, near a hundred small islands are
      separated by shallow water from the continent, and protected from
      the waves by several long slips of land, which admit the entrance
      of vessels through some secret and narrow channels. 56 till the
      middle of the fifth century, these remote and sequestered spots
      remained without cultivation, with few inhabitants, and almost
      without a name. but the manners of the venetian fugitives, their
      arts and their government, were gradually formed by their new
      situation; and one of the epistles of cassiodorus, 57 which
      describes their condition about seventy years afterwards, may be
      considered as the primitive monument of the republic. 571 the
      minister of theodoric compares them, in his quaint declamatory
      style, to water-fowl, who had fixed their nests on the bosom of
      the waves; and though he allows, that the venetian provinces had
      formerly contained many noble families, he insinuates, that they
      were now reduced by misfortune to the same level of humble
      poverty. fish was the common, and almost the universal, food of
      every rank: their only treasure consisted in the plenty of salt,
      which they extracted from the sea: and the exchange of that
      commodity, so essential to human life, was substituted in the
      neighboring markets to the currency of gold and silver. a people,
      whose habitations might be doubtfully assigned to the earth or
      water, soon became alike familiar with the two elements; and the
      demands of avarice succeeded to those of necessity. the
      islanders, who, from grado to chiozza, were intimately connected
      with each other, penetrated into the heart of italy, by the
      secure, though laborious, navigation of the rivers and inland
      canals. their vessels, which were continually increasing in size
      and number, visited all the harbors of the gulf; and the marriage
      which venice annually celebrates with the adriatic, was
      contracted in her early infancy. the epistle of cassiodorus, the
      prtorian prfect, is addressed to the maritime tribunes; and
      he exhorts them, in a mild tone of authority, to animate the zeal
      of their countrymen for the public service, which required their
      assistance to transport the magazines of wine and oil from the
      province of istria to the royal city of ravenna. the ambiguous
      office of these magistrates is explained by the tradition, that,
      in the twelve principal islands, twelve tribunes, or judges, were
      created by an annual and popular election. the existence of the
      venetian republic under the gothic kingdom of italy, is attested
      by the same authentic record, which annihilates their lofty claim
      of original and perpetual independence. 58

      the italians, who had long since renounced the exercise of arms,
      were surprised, after forty years peace, by the approach of a
      formidable barbarian, whom they abhorred, as the enemy of their
      religion, as well as of their republic. amidst the general
      consternation, tius alone was incapable of fear; but it was
      impossible that he should achieve, alone and unassisted, any
      military exploits worthy of his former renown. the barbarians who
      had defended gaul, refused to march to the relief of italy; and
      the succors promised by the eastern emperor were distant and
      doubtful. since tius, at the head of his domestic troops, still
      maintained the field, and harassed or retarded the march of
      attila, he never showed himself more truly great, than at the
      time when his conduct was blamed by an ignorant and ungrateful
      people. 59 if the mind of valentinian had been susceptible of any
      generous sentiments, he would have chosen such a general for his
      example and his guide. but the timid grandson of theodosius,
      instead of sharing the dangers, escaped from the sound of war;
      and his hasty retreat from ravenna to rome, from an impregnable
      fortress to an open capital, betrayed his secret intention of
      abandoning italy, as soon as the danger should approach his
      imperial person. this shameful abdication was suspended, however,
      by the spirit of doubt and delay, which commonly adheres to
      pusillanimous counsels, and sometimes corrects their pernicious
      tendency. the western emperor, with the senate and people of
      rome, embraced the more salutary resolution of deprecating, by a
      solemn and suppliant embassy, the wrath of attila. this important
      commission was accepted by avienus, who, from his birth and
      riches, his consular dignity, the numerous train of his clients,
      and his personal abilities, held the first rank in the roman
      senate. the specious and artful character of avienus 60 was
      admirably qualified to conduct a negotiation either of public or
      private interest: his colleague trigetius had exercised the
      prtorian prfecture of italy; and leo, bishop of rome,
      consented to expose his life for the safety of his flock. the
      genius of leo 61 was exercised and displayed in the public
      misfortunes; and he has deserved the appellation of great, by the
      successful zeal with which he labored to establish his opinions
      and his authority, under the venerable names of orthodox faith
      and ecclesiastical discipline. the roman ambassadors were
      introduced to the tent of attila, as he lay encamped at the place
      where the slow-winding mincius is lost in the foaming waves of
      the lake benacus, 62 and trampled, with his scythian cavalry, the
      farms of catullus and virgil. 63 the barbarian monarch listened
      with favorable, and even respectful, attention; and the
      deliverance of italy was purchased by the immense ransom, or
      dowry, of the princess honoria. the state of his army might
      facilitate the treaty, and hasten his retreat. their martial
      spirit was relaxed by the wealth and idolence of a warm climate.
      the shepherds of the north, whose ordinary food consisted of milk
      and raw flesh, indulged themselves too freely in the use of
      bread, of wine, and of meat, prepared and seasoned by the arts of
      cookery; and the progress of disease revenged in some measure the
      injuries of the italians. 64 when attila declared his resolution
      of carrying his victorious arms to the gates of rome, he was
      admonished by his friends, as well as by his enemies, that alaric
      had not long survived the conquest of the eternal city. his mind,
      superior to real danger, was assaulted by imaginary terrors; nor
      could he escape the influence of superstition, which had so often
      been subservient to his designs. 65 the pressing eloquence of
      leo, his majestic aspect and sacerdotal robes, excited the
      veneration of attila for the spiritual father of the christians.
      the apparition of the two apostles, st. peter and st. paul, who
      menaced the barbarian with instant death, if he rejected the
      prayer of their successor, is one of the noblest legends of
      ecclesiastical tradition. the safety of rome might deserve the
      interposition of celestial beings; and some indulgence is due to
      a fable, which has been represented by the pencil of raphael, and

      before the king of the huns evacuated italy, he threatened to
      return more dreadful, and more implacable, if his bride, the
      princess honoria, were not delivered to his ambassadors within
      the term stipulated by the treaty. yet, in the mean while, attila
      relieved his tender anxiety, by adding a beautiful maid, whose
      name was ildico, to the list of his innumerable wives. 67 their
      marriage was celebrated with barbaric pomp and festivity, at his
      wooden palace beyond the danube; and the monarch, oppressed with
      wine and sleep, retired at a late hour from the banquet to the
      nuptial bed. his attendants continued to respect his pleasures,
      or his repose, the greatest part of the ensuing day, till the
      unusual silence alarmed their fears and suspicions; and, after
      attempting to awaken attila by loud and repeated cries, they at
      length broke into the royal apartment. they found the trembling
      bride sitting by the bedside, hiding her face with her veil, and
      lamenting her own danger, as well as the death of the king, who
      had expired during the night. 68 an artery had suddenly burst:
      and as attila lay in a supine posture, he was suffocated by a
      torrent of blood, which, instead of finding a passage through the
      nostrils, regurgitated into the lungs and stomach. his body was
      solemnly exposed in the midst of the plain, under a silken
      pavilion; and the chosen squadrons of the huns, wheeling round in
      measured evolutions, chanted a funeral song to the memory of a
      hero, glorious in his life, invincible in his death, the father
      of his people, the scourge of his enemies, and the terror of the
      world. according to their national custom, the barbarians cut off
      a part of their hair, gashed their faces with unseemly wounds,
      and bewailed their valiant leader as he deserved, not with the
      tears of women, but with the blood of warriors. the remains of
      attila were enclosed within three coffins, of gold, of silver,
      and of iron, and privately buried in the night: the spoils of
      nations were thrown into his grave; the captives who had opened
      the ground were inhumanly massacred; and the same huns, who had
      indulged such excessive grief, feasted, with dissolute and
      intemperate mirth, about the recent sepulchre of their king. it
      was reported at constantinople, that on the fortunate night on
      which he expired, marcian beheld in a dream the bow of attila
      broken asunder: and the report may be allowed to prove, how
      seldom the image of that formidable barbarian was absent from the
      mind of a roman emperor. 69

      the revolution which subverted the empire of the huns,
      established the fame of attila, whose genius alone had sustained
      the huge and disjointed fabric. after his death, the boldest
      chieftains aspired to the rank of kings; the most powerful kings
      refused to acknowledge a superior; and the numerous sons, whom so
      many various mothers bore to the deceased monarch, divided and
      disputed, like a private inheritance, the sovereign command of
      the nations of germany and scythia. the bold ardaric felt and
      represented the disgrace of this servile partition; and his
      subjects, the warlike gepidae, with the ostrogoths, under the
      conduct of three valiant brothers, encouraged their allies to
      vindicate the rights of freedom and royalty. in a bloody and
      decisive conflict on the banks of the river netad, in pannonia,
      the lance of the gepidae, the sword of the goths, the arrows of
      the huns, the suevic infantry, the light arms of the heruli, and
      the heavy weapons of the alani, encountered or supported each
      other; and the victory of the ardaric was accompanied with the
      slaughter of thirty thousand of his enemies. ellac, the eldest
      son of attila, lost his life and crown in the memorable battle of
      netad: his early valor had raised him to the throne of the
      acatzires, a scythian people, whom he subdued; and his father,
      who loved the superior merit, would have envied the death of
      ellac. 70 his brother, dengisich, with an army of huns, still
      formidable in their flight and ruin, maintained his ground above
      fifteen years on the banks of the danube. the palace of attila,
      with the old country of dacia, from the carpathian hills to the
      euxine, became the seat of a new power, which was erected by
      ardaric, king of the gepidae. the pannonian conquests from vienna
      to sirmium, were occupied by the ostrogoths; and the settlements
      of the tribes, who had so bravely asserted their native freedom,
      were irregularly distributed, according to the measure of their
      respective strength. surrounded and oppressed by the multitude of
      his fathers slaves, the kingdom of dengisich was confined to the
      circle of his wagons; his desperate courage urged him to invade
      the eastern empire: he fell in battle; and his head ignominiously
      exposed in the hippodrome, exhibited a grateful spectacle to the
      people of constantinople. attila had fondly or superstitiously
      believed, that irnac, the youngest of his sons, was destined to
      perpetuate the glories of his race. the character of that prince,
      who attempted to moderate the rashness of his brother dengisich,
      was more suitable to the declining condition of the huns; and
      irnac, with his subject hordes, retired into the heart of the
      lesser scythia. they were soon overwhelmed by a torrent of new
      barbarians, who followed the same road which their own ancestors
      had formerly discovered. the geougen, or avares, whose residence
      is assigned by the greek writers to the shores of the ocean,
      impelled the adjacent tribes; till at length the igours of the
      north, issuing from the cold siberian regions, which produce the
      most valuable furs, spread themselves over the desert, as far as
      the borysthenes and the caspian gates; and finally extinguished
      the empire of the huns. 71

      such an event might contribute to the safety of the eastern
      empire, under the reign of a prince who conciliated the
      friendship, without forfeiting the esteem, of the barbarians. but
      the emperor of the west, the feeble and dissolute valentinian,
      who had reached his thirty-fifth year without attaining the age
      of reason or courage, abused this apparent security, to undermine
      the foundations of his own throne, by the murder of the patrician
      tius. from the instinct of a base and jealous mind, he hated
      the man who was universally celebrated as the terror of the
      barbarians, and the support of the republic; 711 and his new
      favorite, the eunuch heraclius, awakened the emperor from the
      supine lethargy, which might be disguised, during the life of
      placidia, 72 by the excuse of filial piety. the fame of tius,
      his wealth and dignity, the numerous and martial train of
      barbarian followers, his powerful dependants, who filled the
      civil offices of the state, and the hopes of his son gaudentius,
      who was already contracted to eudoxia, the emperors daughter,
      had raised him above the rank of a subject. the ambitious
      designs, of which he was secretly accused, excited the fears, as
      well as the resentment, of valentinian. tius himself, supported
      by the consciousness of his merit, his services, and perhaps his
      innocence, seems to have maintained a haughty and indiscreet
      behavior. the patrician offended his sovereign by a hostile
      declaration; he aggravated the offence, by compelling him to
      ratify, with a solemn oath, a treaty of reconciliation and
      alliance; he proclaimed his suspicions, he neglected his safety;
      and from a vain confidence that the enemy, whom he despised, was
      incapable even of a manly crime, he rashly ventured his person in
      the palace of rome. whilst he urged, perhaps with intemperate
      vehemence, the marriage of his son, valentinian, drawing his
      sword, the first sword he had ever drawn, plunged it in the
      breast of a general who had saved his empire: his courtiers and
      eunuchs ambitiously struggled to imitate their master; and
      tius, pierced with a hundred wounds, fell dead in the royal
      presence. boethius, the prtorian prfect, was killed at the
      same moment, and before the event could be divulged, the
      principal friends of the patrician were summoned to the palace,
      and separately murdered. the horrid deed, palliated by the
      specious names of justice and necessity, was immediately
      communicated by the emperor to his soldiers, his subjects, and
      his allies. the nations, who were strangers or enemies to tius,
      generously deplored the unworthy fate of a hero: the barbarians,
      who had been attached to his service, dissembled their grief and
      resentment: and the public contempt, which had been so long
      entertained for valentinian, was at once converted into deep and
      universal abhorrence. such sentiments seldom pervade the walls of
      a palace; yet the emperor was confounded by the honest reply of a
      roman, whose approbation he had not disdained to solicit. i am
      ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; i only know, that
      you have acted like a man who cuts off his right hand with his
      left. 73

      the preserver of the empire, the conqueror of the most dangerous
      of the barbarians: it is by no means clear that he was not
      innocent of any treasonable designs against valentinian. if the
      early acts of his life, the introduction of the huns into italy,
      and of the vandals into africa, were among the proximate causes
      of the ruin of the empire, his murder was the signal for its
      almost immediate downfall.m.]

      or disgraced avitus and majorian, the successive heroes of his
      song.]

      the luxury of rome seems to have attracted the long and frequent
      visits of valentinian; who was consequently more despised at rome
      than in any other part of his dominions. a republican spirit was
      insensibly revived in the senate, as their authority, and even
      their supplies, became necessary for the support of his feeble
      government. the stately demeanor of an hereditary monarch offended
      their pride; and the pleasures of valentinian were injurious to
      the peace and honor of noble families. the birth of the empress
      eudoxia was equal to his own, and her charms and tender affection
      deserved those testimonies of love which her inconstant husband
      dissipated in vague and unlawful amours. petronius maximus, a
      wealthy senator of the anician family, who had been twice consul,
      was possessed of a chaste and beautiful wife: her obstinate
      resistance served only to irritate the desires of valentinian;
      and he resolved to accomplish them, either by stratagem or force.
      deep gaming was one of the vices of the court: the emperor, who,
      by chance or contrivance, had gained from maximus a considerable
      sum, uncourteously exacted his ring as a security for the debt;
      and sent it by a trusty messenger to his wife, with an order, in
      her husbands name, that she should immediately attend the
      empress eudoxia. the unsuspecting wife of maximus was conveyed in
      her litter to the imperial palace; the emissaries of her
      impatient lover conducted her to a remote and silent bed-chamber;
      and valentinian violated, without remorse, the laws of
      hospitality. her tears, when she returned home, her deep
      affliction, and her bitter reproaches against a husband whom she
      considered as the accomplice of his own shame, excited maximus to
      a just revenge; the desire of revenge was stimulated by ambition;
      and he might reasonably aspire, by the free suffrage of the roman
      senate, to the throne of a detested and despicable rival.
      valentinian, who supposed that every human breast was devoid,
      like his own, of friendship and gratitude, had imprudently
      admitted among his guards several domestics and followers of
      tius. two of these, of barbarian race were persuaded to execute
      a sacred and honorable duty, by punishing with death the assassin
      of their patron; and their intrepid courage did not long expect a
      favorable moment. whilst valentinian amused himself, in the field
      of mars, with the spectacle of some military sports, they
      suddenly rushed upon him with drawn weapons, despatched the
      guilty heraclius, and stabbed the emperor to the heart, without
      the least opposition from his numerous train, who seemed to
      rejoice in the tyrants death. such was the fate of valentinian
      the third, 74 the last roman emperor of the family of theodosius.
      he faithfully imitated the hereditary weakness of his cousin and
      his two uncles, without inheriting the gentleness, the purity,
      the innocence, which alleviate, in their characters, the want of
      spirit and ability. valentinian was less excusable, since he had
      passions, without virtues: even his religion was questionable;
      and though he never deviated into the paths of heresy, he
      scandalized the pious christians by his attachment to the profane
      arts of magic and divination.

      five or six chronicles, none of which were composed in rome or

      as early as the time of cicero and varro, it was the opinion of
      the roman augurs, that the twelve vultures which romulus had
      seen, represented the twelve centuries, assigned for the fatal
      period of his city. 75 this prophecy, disregarded perhaps in the
      season of health and prosperity, inspired the people with gloomy
      apprehensions, when the twelfth century, clouded with disgrace
      and misfortune, was almost elapsed; 76 and even posterity must
      acknowledge with some surprise, that the arbitrary interpretation
      of an accidental or fabulous circumstance has been seriously
      verified in the downfall of the western empire. but its fall was
      announced by a clearer omen than the flight of vultures: the
      roman government appeared every day less formidable to its
      enemies, more odious and oppressive to its subjects. 77 the taxes
      were multiplied with the public distress; economy was neglected
      in proportion as it became necessary; and the injustice of the
      rich shifted the unequal burden from themselves to the people,
      whom they defrauded of the indulgences that might sometimes have
      alleviated their misery. the severe inquisition which confiscated
      their goods, and tortured their persons, compelled the subjects
      of valentinian to prefer the more simple tyranny of the
      barbarians, to fly to the woods and mountains, or to embrace the
      vile and abject condition of mercenary servants. they abjured and
      abhorred the name of roman citizens, which had formerly excited
      the ambition of mankind. the armorican provinces of gaul, and the
      greatest part of spain, were-thrown into a state of disorderly
      independence, by the confederations of the bagaudae; and the
      imperial ministers pursued with proscriptive laws, and
      ineffectual arms, the rebels whom they had made. 78 if all the
      barbarian conquerors had been annihilated in the same hour, their
      total destruction would not have restored the empire of the west:
      and if rome still survived, she survived the loss of freedom, of
      virtue, and of honor.

      the loss or desolation of the provinces, from the ocean to the
      alps, impaired the glory and greatness of rome: her internal
      prosperity was irretrievably destroyed by the separation of
      africa. the rapacious vandals confiscated the patrimonial estates
      of the senators, and intercepted the regular subsidies, which
      relieved the poverty and encouraged the idleness of the
      plebeians. the distress of the romans was soon aggravated by an
      unexpected attack; and the province, so long cultivated for their
      use by industrious and obedient subjects, was armed against them
      by an ambitious barbarian. the vandals and alani, who followed
      the successful standard of genseric, had acquired a rich and
      fertile territory, which stretched along the coast above ninety
      days journey from tangier to tripoli; but their narrow limits
      were pressed and confined, on either side, by the sandy desert
      and the mediterranean. the discovery and conquest of the black
      nations, that might dwell beneath the torrid zone, could not
      tempt the rational ambition of genseric; but he cast his eyes
      towards the sea; he resolved to create a naval power, and his
      bold resolution was executed with steady and active perseverance.

      the woods of mount atlas afforded an inexhaustible nursery of
      timber: his new subjects were skilled in the arts of navigation
      and ship-building; he animated his daring vandals to embrace a
      mode of warfare which would render every maritime country
      accessible to their arms; the moors and africans were allured by
      the hopes of plunder; and, after an interval of six centuries,
      the fleets that issued from the port of carthage again claimed
      the empire of the mediterranean. the success of the vandals, the
      conquest of sicily, the sack of palermo, and the frequent
      descents on the coast of lucania, awakened and alarmed the mother
      of valentinian, and the sister of theodosius. alliances were
      formed; and armaments, expensive and ineffectual, were prepared,
      for the destruction of the common enemy; who reserved his courage
      to encounter those dangers which his policy could not prevent or
      elude. the designs of the roman government were repeatedly
      baffled by his artful delays, ambiguous promises, and apparent
      concessions; and the interposition of his formidable confederate,
      the king of the huns, recalled the emperors from the conquest of
      africa to the care of their domestic safety. the revolutions of
      the palace, which left the western empire without a defender, and
      without a lawful prince, dispelled the apprehensions, and
      stimulated the avarice, of genseric. he immediately equipped a
      numerous fleet of vandals and moors, and cast anchor at the mouth
      of the tyber, about three months after the death of valentinian,
      and the elevation of maximus to the imperial throne.

      the private life of the senator petronius maximus 1 was often
      alleged as a rare example of human felicity. his birth was noble
      and illustrious, since he descended from the anician family; his
      dignity was supported by an adequate patrimony in land and money;
      and these advantages of fortune were accompanied with liberal
      arts and decent manners, which adorn or imitate the inestimable
      gifts of genius and virtue. the luxury of his palace and table
      was hospitable and elegant. whenever maximus appeared in public,
      he was surrounded by a train of grateful and obsequious clients;
      2 and it is possible that among these clients, he might deserve
      and possess some real friends. his merit was rewarded by the
      favor of the prince and senate: he thrice exercised the office of
      prtorian prfect of italy; he was twice invested with the
      consulship, and he obtained the rank of patrician. these civil
      honors were not incompatible with the enjoyment of leisure and
      tranquillity; his hours, according to the demands of pleasure or
      reason, were accurately distributed by a water-clock; and this
      avarice of time may be allowed to prove the sense which maximus
      entertained of his own happiness. the injury which he received
      from the emperor valentinian appears to excuse the most bloody
      revenge. yet a philosopher might have reflected, that, if the
      resistance of his wife had been sincere, her chastity was still
      inviolate, and that it could never be restored if she had
      consented to the will of the adulterer. a patriot would have
      hesitated before he plunged himself and his country into those
      inevitable calamities which must follow the extinction of the
      royal house of theodosius. the imprudent maximus disregarded
      these salutary considerations; he gratified his resentment and
      ambition; he saw the bleeding corpse of valentinian at his feet;
      and he heard himself saluted emperor by the unanimous voice of
      the senate and people. but the day of his inauguration was the
      last day of his happiness. he was imprisoned (such is the lively
      expression of sidonius) in the palace; and after passing a
      sleepless night, he sighed that he had attained the summit of his
      wishes, and aspired only to descend from the dangerous elevation.
      oppressed by the weight of the diadem, he communicated his
      anxious thoughts to his friend and quaestor fulgentius; and when
      he looked back with unavailing regret on the secure pleasures of
      his former life, the emperor exclaimed, o fortunate damocles, 3
      thy reign began and ended with the same dinner; a well-known
      allusion, which fulgentius afterwards repeated as an instructive
      lesson for princes and subjects.

      of the second book, to refute the paradox of his friend serranus,
      who entertained a singular, though generous, enthusiasm for the
      deceased emperor. this epistle, with some indulgence, may claim
      the praise of an elegant composition; and it throws much light on
      the character of maximus.]

      sidonius concludes his letter with the story of damocles, which
      cicero (tusculan. v. 20, 21) had so inimitably told.]

      the reign of maximus continued about three months. his hours, of
      which he had lost the command, were disturbed by remorse, or
      guilt, or terror, and his throne was shaken by the seditions of
      the soldiers, the people, and the confederate barbarians. the
      marriage of his son paladius with the eldest daughter of the late
      emperor, might tend to establish the hereditary succession of his
      family; but the violence which he offered to the empress eudoxia,
      could proceed only from the blind impulse of lust or revenge. his
      own wife, the cause of these tragic events, had been seasonably
      removed by death; and the widow of valentinian was compelled to
      violate her decent mourning, perhaps her real grief, and to
      submit to the embraces of a presumptuous usurper, whom she
      suspected as the assassin of her deceased husband. these
      suspicions were soon justified by the indiscreet confession of
      maximus himself; and he wantonly provoked the hatred of his
      reluctant bride, who was still conscious that she was descended
      from a line of emperors. from the east, however, eudoxia could
      not hope to obtain any effectual assistance; her father and her
      aunt pulcheria were dead; her mother languished at jerusalem in
      disgrace and exile; and the sceptre of constantinople was in the
      hands of a stranger. she directed her eyes towards carthage;
      secretly implored the aid of the king of the vandals; and
      persuaded genseric to improve the fair opportunity of disguising
      his rapacious designs by the specious names of honor, justice,
      and compassion. 4 whatever abilities maximus might have shown in
      a subordinate station, he was found incapable of administering an
      empire; and though he might easily have been informed of the
      naval preparations which were made on the opposite shores of
      africa, he expected with supine indifference the approach of the
      enemy, without adopting any measures of defence, of negotiation,
      or of a timely retreat. when the vandals disembarked at the mouth
      of the tyber, the emperor was suddenly roused from his lethargy
      by the clamors of a trembling and exasperated multitude. the only
      hope which presented itself to his astonished mind was that of a
      precipitate flight, and he exhorted the senators to imitate the
      example of their prince. but no sooner did maximus appear in the
      streets, than he was assaulted by a shower of stones; a roman, or
      a burgundian soldier, claimed the honor of the first wound; his
      mangled body was ignominiously cast into the tyber; the roman
      people rejoiced in the punishment which they had inflicted on the
      author of the public calamities; and the domestics of eudoxia
      signalized their zeal in the service of their mistress. 5

      idatius marcellinus, &c., the learned muratori (annali ditalia,
      tom. iv. p. 249) doubts the reality of this invitation, and
      observes, with great truth, non si puo dir quanto sia facile il
      popolo a sognare e spacciar voci false. but his argument, from
      the interval of time and place, is extremely feeble. the figs
      which grew near carthage were produced to the senate of rome on
      the third day.]

      a remarkable line, which insinuates that rome and maximus were
      betrayed by their burgundian mercenaries.]

      on the third day after the tumult, genseric boldly advanced from
      the port of ostia to the gates of the defenceless city. instead
      of a sally of the roman youth, there issued from the gates an
      unarmed and venerable procession of the bishop at the head of his
      clergy. 6 the fearless spirit of leo, his authority and
      eloquence, again mitigated the fierceness of a barbarian
      conqueror; the king of the vandals promised to spare the
      unresisting multitude, to protect the buildings from fire, and to
      exempt the captives from torture; and although such orders were
      neither seriously given, nor strictly obeyed, the mediation of
      leo was glorious to himself, and in some degree beneficial to his
      country. but rome and its inhabitants were delivered to the
      licentiousness of the vandals and moors, whose blind passions
      revenged the injuries of carthage. the pillage lasted fourteen
      days and nights; and all that yet remained of public or private
      wealth, of sacred or profane treasure, was diligently transported
      to the vessels of genseric. among the spoils, the splendid relics
      of two temples, or rather of two religions, exhibited a memorable
      example of the vicissitudes of human and divine things.

      since the abolition of paganism, the capitol had been violated
      and abandoned; yet the statues of the gods and heroes were still
      respected, and the curious roof of gilt bronze was reserved for
      the rapacious hands of genseric. 7 the holy instruments of the
      jewish worship, 8 the gold table, and the gold candlestick with
      seven branches, originally framed according to the particular
      instructions of god himself, and which were placed in the
      sanctuary of his temple, had been ostentatiously displayed to the
      roman people in the triumph of titus. they were afterwards
      deposited in the temple of peace; and at the end of four hundred
      years, the spoils of jerusalem were transferred from rome to
      carthage, by a barbarian who derived his origin from the shores
      of the baltic. these ancient monuments might attract the notice
      of curiosity, as well as of avarice. but the christian churches,
      enriched and adorned by the prevailing superstition of the times,
      afforded more plentiful materials for sacrilege; and the pious
      liberality of pope leo, who melted six silver vases, the gift of
      constantine, each of a hundred pounds weight, is an evidence of
      the damage which he attempted to repair. in the forty-five years
      that had elapsed since the gothic invasion, the pomp and luxury
      of rome were in some measure restored; and it was difficult
      either to escape, or to satisfy, the avarice of a conqueror, who
      possessed leisure to collect, and ships to transport, the wealth
      of the capital. the imperial ornaments of the palace, the
      magnificent furniture and wardrobe, the sideboards of massy
      plate, were accumulated with disorderly rapine; the gold and
      silver amounted to several thousand talents; yet even the brass
      and copper were laboriously removed. eudoxia herself, who
      advanced to meet her friend and deliverer, soon bewailed the
      imprudence of her own conduct. she was rudely stripped of her
      jewels; and the unfortunate empress, with her two daughters, the
      only surviving remains of the great theodosius, was compelled, as
      a captive, to follow the haughty vandal; who immediately hoisted
      sail, and returned with a prosperous navigation to the port of
      carthage. 9 many thousand romans of both sexes, chosen for some
      useful or agreeable qualifications, reluctantly embarked on board
      the fleet of genseric; and their distress was aggravated by the
      unfeeling barbarians, who, in the division of the booty,
      separated the wives from their husbands, and the children from
      their parents. the charity of deogratias, bishop of carthage, 10
      was their only consolation and support. he generously sold the
      gold and silver plate of the church to purchase the freedom of
      some, to alleviate the slavery of others, and to assist the wants
      and infirmities of a captive multitude, whose health was impaired
      by the hardships which they had suffered in their passage from
      italy to africa. by his order, two spacious churches were
      converted into hospitals; the sick were distributed into
      convenient beds, and liberally supplied with food and medicines;
      and the aged prelate repeated his visits both in the day and
      night, with an assiduity that surpassed his strength, and a
      tender sympathy which enhanced the value of his services. compare
      this scene with the field of cannae; and judge between hannibal
      and the successor of st. cyprian. 11

      6 (return) [the apparant success of pope leo may be justified by
      prosper, and the historia miscellan.; but the improbable notion
      of baronius a.d. 455, (no. 13) that genseric spared the three
      apostolical churches, is not countenanced even by the doubtful
      testimony of the liber pontificalis.]

      7 (return) [ the profusion of catulus, the first who gilt the
      roof of the capitol, was not universally approved, (plin. hist.
      natur. xxxiii. 18;) but it was far exceeded by the emperors, and
      the external gilding of the temple cost domitian 12,000 talents,
      (2,400,000 l.) the expressions of claudian and rutilius (luce
      metalli oemula.... fastigia astris, and confunduntque vagos
      delubra micantia visus) manifestly prove, that this splendid
      covering was not removed either by the christians or the goths,
      (see donatus, roma antiqua, l. ii. c. 6, p. 125.) it should seem
      that the roof of the capitol was decorated with gilt statues, and
      chariots drawn by four horses.]

      11 (return) [ the general evidence for the death of maximus, and
      the sack of rome by the vandals, is comprised in sidonius,
      (panegyr. avit. 441-450,) procopius, (de bell. vandal. l. i. c.
      4, 5, p. 188, 189, and l. ii. c. 9, p. 255,) evagrius, (l. ii. c.

      chronicles of idatius, prosper, marcellinus, and theophanes,
      under the proper year.]

      the deaths of tius and valentinian had relaxed the ties which
      held the barbarians of gaul in peace and subordination. the
      sea-coast was infested by the saxons; the alemanni and the franks
      advanced from the rhine to the seine; and the ambition of the
      goths seemed to meditate more extensive and permanent conquests.
      the emperor maximus relieved himself, by a judicious choice, from
      the weight of these distant cares; he silenced the solicitations
      of his friends, listened to the voice of fame, and promoted a
      stranger to the general command of the forces of gaul.

      avitus, 12 the stranger, whose merit was so nobly rewarded,
      descended from a wealthy and honorable family in the diocese of
      auvergne. the convulsions of the times urged him to embrace, with
      the same ardor, the civil and military professions: and the
      indefatigable youth blended the studies of literature and
      jurisprudence with the exercise of arms and hunting. thirty years
      of his life were laudably spent in the public service; he
      alternately displayed his talents in war and negotiation; and the
      soldier of tius, after executing the most important embassies,
      was raised to the station of prtorian prfect of gaul. either
      the merit of avitus excited envy, or his moderation was desirous
      of repose, since he calmly retired to an estate, which he
      possessed in the neighborhood of clermont. a copious stream,
      issuing from the mountain, and falling headlong in many a loud
      and foaming cascade, discharged its waters into a lake about two
      miles in length, and the villa was pleasantly seated on the
      margin of the lake. the baths, the porticos, the summer and
      winter apartments, were adapted to the purposes of luxury and
      use; and the adjacent country afforded the various prospects of
      woods, pastures, and meadows. 13 in this retreat, where avitus
      amused his leisure with books, rural sports, the practice of
      husbandry, and the society of his friends, 14 he received the
      imperial diploma, which constituted him master-general of the
      cavalry and infantry of gaul. he assumed the military command;
      the barbarians suspended their fury; and whatever means he might
      employ, whatever concessions he might be forced to make, the
      people enjoyed the benefits of actual tranquillity. but the fate
      of gaul depended on the visigoths; and the roman general, less
      attentive to his dignity than to the public interest, did not
      disdain to visit thoulouse in the character of an ambassador. he
      was received with courteous hospitality by theodoric, the king of
      the goths; but while avitus laid the foundations of a solid
      alliance with that powerful nation, he was astonished by the
      intelligence, that the emperor maximus was slain, and that rome
      had been pillaged by the vandals. a vacant throne, which he might
      ascend without guilt or danger, tempted his ambition; 15 and the
      visigoths were easily persuaded to support his claim by their
      irresistible suffrage. they loved the person of avitus; they
      respected his virtues; and they were not insensible of the
      advantage, as well as honor, of giving an emperor to the west.
      the season was now approaching, in which the annual assembly of
      the seven provinces was held at arles; their deliberations might
      perhaps be influenced by the presence of theodoric and his
      martial brothers; but their choice would naturally incline to the
      most illustrious of their countrymen. avitus, after a decent
      resistance, accepted the imperial diadem from the representatives
      of gaul; and his election was ratified by the acclamations of the
      barbarians and provincials. the formal consent of marcian,
      emperor of the east, was solicited and obtained; but the senate,
      rome, and italy, though humbled by their recent calamities,
      submitted with a secret murmur to the presumption of the gallic
      usurper.

      12 (return) [ the private life and elevation of avitus must be
      deduced, with becoming suspicion, from the panegyric pronounced
      by sidonius apollinaris, his subject, and his son-in-law.]

      13 (return) [ after the example of the younger pliny, sidonius
      (l. ii. c. 2) has labored the florid, prolix, and obscure
      description of his villa, which bore the name, (avitacum,) and
      had been the property of avitus. the precise situation is not
      ascertained. consult, however, the notes of savaron and sirmond.]

      14 (return) [ sidonius (l. ii. epist. 9) has described the
      country life of the gallic nobles, in a visit which he made to
      his friends, whose estates were in the neighborhood of nismes.
      the morning hours were spent in the sphoeristerium, or
      tennis-court; or in the library, which was furnished with latin
      authors, profane and religious; the former for the men, the
      latter for the ladies. the table was twice served, at dinner and
      supper, with hot meat (boiled and roast) and wine. during the
      intermediate time, the company slept, took the air on horseback,
      and need the warm bath.]

      15 (return) [ seventy lines of panegyric (505-575) which describe
      the importunity of theodoric and of gaul, struggling to overcome
      the modest reluctance of avitus, are blown away by three words of
      an honest historian. romanum ambisset imperium, (greg. turon. l.
      ii. c. 1l, in tom. ii. p. 168.)]

      theodoric, to whom avitus was indebted for the purple, had
      acquired the gothic sceptre by the murder of his elder brother
      torismond; and he justified this atrocious deed by the design
      which his predecessor had formed of violating his alliance with
      the empire. 16 such a crime might not be incompatible with the
      virtues of a barbarian; but the manners of theodoric were gentle
      and humane; and posterity may contemplate without terror the
      original picture of a gothic king, whom sidonius had intimately
      observed, in the hours of peace and of social intercourse. in an
      epistle, dated from the court of thoulouse, the orator satisfies
      the curiosity of one of his friends, in the following
      description: 17 by the majesty of his appearance, theodoric
      would command the respect of those who are ignorant of his merit;
      and although he is born a prince, his merit would dignify a
      private station. he is of a middle stature, his body appears
      rather plump than fat, and in his well-proportioned limbs agility
      is united with muscular strength. 18 if you examine his
      countenance, you will distinguish a high forehead, large shaggy
      eyebrows, an aquiline nose, thin lips, a regular set of white
      teeth, and a fair complexion, that blushes more frequently from
      modesty than from anger. the ordinary distribution of his time,
      as far as it is exposed to the public view, may be concisely
      represented. before daybreak, he repairs, with a small train, to
      his domestic chapel, where the service is performed by the arian
      clergy; but those who presume to interpret his secret sentiments,
      consider this assiduous devotion as the effect of habit and
      policy. the rest of the morning is employed in the administration
      of his kingdom. his chair is surrounded by some military officers
      of decent aspect and behavior: the noisy crowd of his barbarian
      guards occupies the hall of audience; but they are not permitted
      to stand within the veils or curtains that conceal the
      council-chamber from vulgar eyes. the ambassadors of the nations
      are successively introduced: theodoric listens with attention,
      answers them with discreet brevity, and either announces or
      delays, according to the nature of their business, his final
      resolution. about eight (the second hour) he rises from his
      throne, and visits either his treasury or his stables. if he
      chooses to hunt, or at least to exercise himself on horseback,
      his bow is carried by a favorite youth; but when the game is
      marked, he bends it with his own hand, and seldom misses the
      object of his aim: as a king, he disdains to bear arms in such
      ignoble warfare; but as a soldier, he would blush to accept any
      military service which he could perform himself. on common days,
      his dinner is not different from the repast of a private citizen,
      but every saturday, many honorable guests are invited to the
      royal table, which, on these occasions, is served with the
      elegance of greece, the plenty of gaul, and the order and
      diligence of italy. 19 the gold or silver plate is less
      remarkable for its weight than for the brightness and curious
      workmanship: the taste is gratified without the help of foreign
      and costly luxury; the size and number of the cups of wine are
      regulated with a strict regard to the laws of temperance; and the
      respectful silence that prevails, is interrupted only by grave
      and instructive conversation. after dinner, theodoric sometimes
      indulges himself in a short slumber; and as soon as he wakes, he
      calls for the dice and tables, encourages his friends to forget
      the royal majesty, and is delighted when they freely express the
      passions which are excited by the incidents of play. at this
      game, which he loves as the image of war, he alternately displays
      his eagerness, his skill, his patience, and his cheerful temper.
      if he loses, he laughs; he is modest and silent if he wins. yet,
      notwithstanding this seeming indifference, his courtiers choose
      to solicit any favor in the moments of victory; and i myself, in
      my applications to the king, have derived some benefit from my
      losses. 20 about the ninth hour (three oclock) the tide of
      business again returns, and flows incessantly till after sunset,
      when the signal of the royal supper dismisses the weary crowd of
      suppliants and pleaders. at the supper, a more familiar repast,
      buffoons and pantomimes are sometimes introduced, to divert, not
      to offend, the company, by their ridiculous wit: but female
      singers, and the soft, effeminate modes of music, are severely
      banished, and such martial tunes as animate the soul to deeds of
      valor are alone grateful to the ear of theodoric. he retires from
      table; and the nocturnal guards are immediately posted at the
      entrance of the treasury, the palace, and the private
      apartments.

      when the king of the visigoths encouraged avitus to assume the
      purple, he offered his person and his forces, as a faithful
      soldier of the republic. 21 the exploits of theodoric soon
      convinced the world that he had not degenerated from the warlike
      virtues of his ancestors. after the establishment of the goths in
      aquitain, and the passage of the vandals into africa, the suevi,
      who had fixed their kingdom in gallicia, aspired to the conquest
      of spain, and threatened to extinguish the feeble remains of the
      roman dominion. the provincials of carthagena and tarragona,
      afflicted by a hostile invasion, represented their injuries and
      their apprehensions. count fronto was despatched, in the name of
      the emperor avitus, with advantageous offers of peace and
      alliance; and theodoric interposed his weighty mediation, to
      declare, that, unless his brother-in-law, the king of the suevi,
      immediately retired, he should be obliged to arm in the cause of
      justice and of rome. tell him, replied the haughty rechiarius,
      that i despise his friendship and his arms; but that i shall
      soon try whether he will dare to expect my arrival under the
      walls of thoulouse. such a challenge urged theodoric to prevent
      the bold designs of his enemy; he passed the pyrenees at the head
      of the visigoths: the franks and burgundians served under his
      standard; and though he professed himself the dutiful servant of
      avitus, he privately stipulated, for himself and his successors,
      the absolute possession of his spanish conquests. the two armies,
      or rather the two nations, encountered each other on the banks of
      the river urbicus, about twelve miles from astorga; and the
      decisive victory of the goths appeared for a while to have
      extirpated the name and kingdom of the suevi. from the field of
      battle theodoric advanced to braga, their metropolis, which still
      retained the splendid vestiges of its ancient commerce and
      dignity. 22 his entrance was not polluted with blood; and the
      goths respected the chastity of their female captives, more
      especially of the consecrated virgins: but the greatest part of
      the clergy and people were made slaves, and even the churches and
      altars were confounded in the universal pillage. the unfortunate
      king of the suevi had escaped to one of the ports of the ocean;
      but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his flight: he was
      delivered to his implacable rival; and rechiarius, who neither
      desired nor expected mercy, received, with manly constancy, the
      death which he would probably have inflicted. after this bloody
      sacrifice to policy or resentment, theodoric carried his
      victorious arms as far as merida, the principal town of
      lusitania, without meeting any resistance, except from the
      miraculous powers of st. eulalia; but he was stopped in the full
      career of success, and recalled from spain before he could
      provide for the security of his conquests. in his retreat towards
      the pyrenees, he revenged his disappointment on the country
      through which he passed; and, in the sack of pollentia and
      astorga, he showed himself a faithless ally, as well as a cruel
      enemy. whilst the king of the visigoths fought and vanquished in
      the name of avitus, the reign of avitus had expired; and both the
      honor and the interest of theodoric were deeply wounded by the
      disgrace of a friend, whom he had seated on the throne of the
      western empire. 23

      chapter xxxvi: total extinction of the western empire.part ii.

      the pressing solicitations of the senate and people persuaded the
      emperor avitus to fix his residence at rome, and to accept the
      consulship for the ensuing year. on the first day of january, his
      son-in-law, sidonius apollinaris, celebrated his praises in a
      panegyric of six hundred verses; but this composition, though it
      was rewarded with a brass statue, 24 seems to contain a very
      moderate proportion, either of genius or of truth. the poet, if
      we may degrade that sacred name, exaggerates the merit of a
      sovereign and a father; and his prophecy of a long and glorious
      reign was soon contradicted by the event. avitus, at a time when
      the imperial dignity was reduced to a preeminence of toil and
      danger, indulged himself in the pleasures of italian luxury: age
      had not extinguished his amorous inclinations; and he is accused
      of insulting, with indiscreet and ungenerous raillery, the
      husbands whose wives he had seduced or violated. 25 but the
      romans were not inclined either to excuse his faults or to
      acknowledge his virtues. the several parts of the empire became
      every day more alienated from each other; and the stranger of
      gaul was the object of popular hatred and contempt. the senate
      asserted their legitimate claim in the election of an emperor;
      and their authority, which had been originally derived from the
      old constitution, was again fortified by the actual weakness of a
      declining monarchy. yet even such a monarchy might have resisted
      the votes of an unarmed senate, if their discontent had not been
      supported, or perhaps inflamed, by the count ricimer, one of the
      principal commanders of the barbarian troops, who formed the
      military defence of italy. the daughter of wallia, king of the
      visigoths, was the mother of ricimer; but he was descended, on
      the fathers side, from the nation of the suevi; 26 his pride or
      patriotism might be exasperated by the misfortunes of his
      countrymen; and he obeyed, with reluctance, an emperor in whose
      elevation he had not been consulted. his faithful and important
      services against the common enemy rendered him still more
      formidable; 27 and, after destroying on the coast of corsica a
      fleet of vandals, which consisted of sixty galleys, ricimer
      returned in triumph with the appellation of the deliverer of
      italy. he chose that moment to signify to avitus, that his reign
      was at an end; and the feeble emperor, at a distance from his
      gothic allies, was compelled, after a short and unavailing
      struggle to abdicate the purple. by the clemency, however, or the
      contempt, of ricimer, 28 he was permitted to descend from the
      throne to the more desirable station of bishop of placentia: but
      the resentment of the senate was still unsatisfied; and their
      inflexible severity pronounced the sentence of his death. he fled
      towards the alps, with the humble hope, not of arming the
      visigoths in his cause, but of securing his person and treasures
      in the sanctuary of julian, one of the tutelar saints of
      auvergne. 29 disease, or the hand of the executioner, arrested
      him on the road; yet his remains were decently transported to
      brivas, or brioude, in his native province, and he reposed at the
      feet of his holy patron. 30 avitus left only one daughter, the
      wife of sidonius apollinaris, who inherited the patrimony of his
      father-in-law; lamenting, at the same time, the disappointment of
      his public and private expectations. his resentment prompted him
      to join, or at least to countenance, the measures of a rebellious
      faction in gaul; and the poet had contracted some guilt, which it
      was incumbent on him to expiate, by a new tribute of flattery to
      the succeeding emperor. 31

      the successor of avitus presents the welcome discovery of a great
      and heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a degenerate
      age, to vindicate the honor of the human species. the emperor
      majorian has deserved the praises of his contemporaries, and of
      posterity; and these praises may be strongly expressed in the
      words of a judicious and disinterested historian: that he was
      gentle to his subjects; that he was terrible to his enemies; and
      that he excelled, in every virtue, all his predecessors who had
      reigned over the romans. 32 such a testimony may justify at
      least the panegyric of sidonius; and we may acquiesce in the
      assurance, that, although the obsequious orator would have
      flattered, with equal zeal, the most worthless of princes, the
      extraordinary merit of his object confined him, on this occasion,
      within the bounds of truth. 33 majorian derived his name from his
      maternal grandfather, who, in the reign of the great theodosius,
      had commanded the troops of the illyrian frontier. he gave his
      daughter in marriage to the father of majorian, a respectable
      officer, who administered the revenues of gaul with skill and
      integrity; and generously preferred the friendship of tius to
      the tempting offer of an insidious court. his son, the future
      emperor, who was educated in the profession of arms, displayed,
      from his early youth, intrepid courage, premature wisdom, and
      unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune. he followed the
      standard of tius, contributed to his success, shared, and
      sometimes eclipsed, his glory, and at last excited the jealousy
      of the patrician, or rather of his wife, who forced him to retire
      from the service. 34 majorian, after the death of tius, was
      recalled and promoted; and his intimate connection with count
      ricimer was the immediate step by which he ascended the throne of
      the western empire. during the vacancy that succeeded the
      abdication of avitus, the ambitious barbarian, whose birth
      excluded him from the imperial dignity, governed italy with the
      title of patrician; resigned to his friend the conspicuous
      station of master-general of the cavalry and infantry; and, after
      an interval of some months, consented to the unanimous wish of
      the romans, whose favor majorian had solicited by a recent
      victory over the alemanni. 35 he was invested with the purple at
      ravenna: and the epistle which he addressed to the senate, will
      best describe his situation and his sentiments. your election,
      conscript fathers! and the ordinance of the most valiant army,
      have made me your emperor. 36 may the propitious deity direct and
      prosper the counsels and events of my administration, to your
      advantage and to the public welfare! for my own part, i did not
      aspire, i have submitted to reign; nor should i have discharged
      the obligations of a citizen if i had refused, with base and
      selfish ingratitude, to support the weight of those labors, which
      were imposed by the republic. assist, therefore, the prince whom
      you have made; partake the duties which you have enjoined; and

      which, as a subject, i have always condemned, and, as a prince,
      will severely punish. our own vigilance, and that of our father,
      the patrician ricimer, shall regulate all military affairs, and
      provide for the safety of the roman world, which we have saved
      from foreign and domestic enemies. 38 you now understand the
      maxims of my government; you may confide in the faithful love and
      sincere assurances of a prince who has formerly been the
      companion of your life and dangers; who still glories in the name
      of senator, and who is anxious that you should never repent the
      judgment which you have pronounced in his favor. the emperor,
      who, amidst the ruins of the roman world, revived the ancient
      language of law and liberty, which trajan would not have
      disclaimed, must have derived those generous sentiments from his
      own heart; since they were not suggested to his imitation by the
      customs of his age, or the example of his predecessors. 39

      studied the causes of the decline of the empire, and who was
      capable of applying (as far as such reformation was practicable)

      regulations concerning the finances manifestly tended to remove,
      or at least to mitigate, the most intolerable grievances. i. from

      own words) to relieve the weary fortunes of the provincials,
      oppressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and
      superindictions. 41 with this view he granted a universal
      amnesty, a final and absolute discharge of all arrears of
      tribute, of all debts, which, under any pretence, the fiscal
      officers might demand from the people. this wise dereliction of
      obsolete, vexatious, and unprofitable claims, improved and
      purified the sources of the public revenue; and the subject who
      could now look back without despair, might labor with hope and
      gratitude for himself and for his country. ii. in the assessment
      and collection of taxes, majorian restored the ordinary
      jurisdiction of the provincial magistrates; and suppressed the
      extraordinary commissions which had been introduced, in the name
      of the emperor himself, or of the prtorian prfects. the
      favorite servants, who obtained such irregular powers, were
      insolent in their behavior, and arbitrary in their demands: they
      affected to despise the subordinate tribunals, and they were
      discontented, if their fees and profits did not twice exceed the
      sum which they condescended to pay into the treasury. one
      instance of their extortion would appear incredible, were it not
      authenticated by the legislator himself. they exacted the whole
      payment in gold: but they refused the current coin of the empire,
      and would accept only such ancient pieces as were stamped with
      the names of faustina or the antonines. the subject, who was
      unprovided with these curious medals, had recourse to the
      expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands; or if he
      succeeded in the research, his imposition was doubled, according
      to the weight and value of the money of former times. 42 iii.
      the municipal corporations, (says the emperor,) the lesser
      senates, (so antiquity has justly styled them,) deserve to be
      considered as the heart of the cities, and the sinews of the
      republic. and yet so low are they now reduced, by the injustice
      of magistrates and the venality of collectors, that many of their
      members, renouncing their dignity and their country, have taken
      refuge in distant and obscure exile. he urges, and even compels,
      their return to their respective cities; but he removes the
      grievance which had forced them to desert the exercise of their
      municipal functions. they are directed, under the authority of
      the provincial magistrates, to resume their office of levying the
      tribute; but, instead of being made responsible for the whole sum
      assessed on their district, they are only required to produce a
      regular account of the payments which they have actually
      received, and of the defaulters who are still indebted to the
      public. iv. but majorian was not ignorant that these corporate
      bodies were too much inclined to retaliate the injustice and
      oppression which they had suffered; and he therefore revives the
      useful office of the defenders of cities. he exhorts the people
      to elect, in a full and free assembly, some man of discretion and
      integrity, who would dare to assert their privileges, to
      represent their grievances, to protect the poor from the tyranny
      of the rich, and to inform the emperor of the abuses that were
      committed under the sanction of his name and authority.

      the spectator who casts a mournful view over the ruins of ancient
      rome, is tempted to accuse the memory of the goths and vandals,
      for the mischief which they had neither leisure, nor power, nor
      perhaps inclination, to perpetrate. the tempest of war might
      strike some lofty turrets to the ground; but the destruction
      which undermined the foundations of those massy fabrics was
      prosecuted, slowly and silently, during a period of ten
      centuries; and the motives of interest, that afterwards operated
      without shame or control, were severely checked by the taste and
      spirit of the emperor majorian. the decay of the city had
      gradually impaired the value of the public works. the circus and
      theatres might still excite, but they seldom gratified, the
      desires of the people: the temples, which had escaped the zeal of
      the christians, were no longer inhabited, either by gods or men;
      the diminished crowds of the romans were lost in the immense
      space of their baths and porticos; and the stately libraries and
      halls of justice became useless to an indolent generation, whose
      repose was seldom disturbed, either by study or business. the
      monuments of consular, or imperial, greatness were no longer
      revered, as the immortal glory of the capital: they were only
      esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials, cheaper, and more
      convenient than the distant quarry. specious petitions were
      continually addressed to the easy magistrates of rome, which
      stated the want of stones or bricks, for some necessary service:
      the fairest forms of architecture were rudely defaced, for the
      sake of some paltry, or pretended, repairs; and the degenerate
      romans, who converted the spoil to their own emolument,
      demolished, with sacrilegious hands, the labors of their
      ancestors. majorian, who had often sighed over the desolation of
      the city, applied a severe remedy to the growing evil. 43 he
      reserved to the prince and senate the sole cognizance of the
      extreme cases which might justify the destruction of an ancient
      edifice; imposed a fine of fifty pounds of gold (two thousand
      pounds sterling) on every magistrate who should presume to grant
      such illegal and scandalous license, and threatened to chastise
      the criminal obedience of their subordinate officers, by a severe
      whipping, and the amputation of both their hands. in the last
      instance, the legislator might seem to forget the proportion of
      guilt and punishment; but his zeal arose from a generous
      principle, and majorian was anxious to protect the monuments of
      those ages, in which he would have desired and deserved to live.
      the emperor conceived, that it was his interest to increase the
      number of his subjects; and that it was his duty to guard the
      purity of the marriage-bed: but the means which he employed to
      accomplish these salutary purposes are of an ambiguous, and
      perhaps exceptionable, kind. the pious maids, who consecrated
      their virginity to christ, were restrained from taking the veil
      till they had reached their fortieth year. widows under that age
      were compelled to form a second alliance within the term of five
      years, by the forfeiture of half their wealth to their nearest
      relations, or to the state. unequal marriages were condemned or
      annulled. the punishment of confiscation and exile was deemed so
      inadequate to the guilt of adultery, that, if the criminal
      returned to italy, he might, by the express declaration of
      majorian, be slain with impunity. 44

      majorian, which punished obstinate widows, was soon afterwards
      repealed by his successor severus, (novell. sever. tit. i. p.
      37.)]

      while the emperor majorian assiduously labored to restore the
      happiness and virtue of the romans, he encountered the arms of
      genseric, from his character and situation their most formidable
      enemy. a fleet of vandals and moors landed at the mouth of the
      liris, or garigliano; but the imperial troops surprised and
      attacked the disorderly barbarians, who were encumbered with the
      spoils of campania; they were chased with slaughter to their
      ships, and their leader, the kings brother-in-law, was found in
      the number of the slain. 45 such vigilance might announce the
      character of the new reign; but the strictest vigilance, and the
      most numerous forces, were insufficient to protect the
      long-extended coast of italy from the depredations of a naval
      war. the public opinion had imposed a nobler and more arduous
      task on the genius of majorian. rome expected from him alone the
      restitution of africa; and the design, which he formed, of
      attacking the vandals in their new settlements, was the result of
      bold and judicious policy. if the intrepid emperor could have
      infused his own spirit into the youth of italy; if he could have
      revived in the field of mars, the manly exercises in which he had
      always surpassed his equals; he might have marched against
      genseric at the head of a roman army. such a reformation of
      national manners might be embraced by the rising generation; but
      it is the misfortune of those princes who laboriously sustain a
      declining monarchy, that, to obtain some immediate advantage, or
      to avert some impending danger, they are forced to countenance,
      and even to multiply, the most pernicious abuses. majorian, like
      the weakest of his predecessors, was reduced to the disgraceful
      expedient of substituting barbarian auxiliaries in the place of
      his unwarlike subjects: and his superior abilities could only be
      displayed in the vigor and dexterity with which he wielded a
      dangerous instrument, so apt to recoil on the hand that used it.
      besides the confederates, who were already engaged in the service
      of the empire, the fame of his liberality and valor attracted the
      nations of the danube, the borysthenes, and perhaps of the
      tanais. many thousands of the bravest subjects of attila, the
      gepidae, the ostrogoths, the rugians, the burgundians, the suevi,
      the alani, assembled in the plains of liguria; and their
      formidable strength was balanced by their mutual animosities. 46
      they passed the alps in a severe winter. the emperor led the way,
      on foot, and in complete armor; sounding, with his long staff,
      the depth of the ice, or snow, and encouraging the scythians, who
      complained of the extreme cold, by the cheerful assurance, that
      they should be satisfied with the heat of africa. the citizens of
      lyons had presumed to shut their gates; they soon implored, and
      experienced, the clemency of majorian. he vanquished theodoric in
      the field; and admitted to his friendship and alliance a king
      whom he had found not unworthy of his arms. the beneficial,
      though precarious, reunion of the greater part of gaul and spain,
      was the effect of persuasion, as well as of force; 47 and the
      independent bagaudae, who had escaped, or resisted, the
      oppression, of former reigns, were disposed to confide in the
      virtues of majorian. his camp was filled with barbarian allies;
      his throne was supported by the zeal of an affectionate people;
      but the emperor had foreseen, that it was impossible, without a
      maritime power, to achieve the conquest of africa. in the first
      punic war, the republic had exerted such incredible diligence,
      that, within sixty days after the first stroke of the axe had
      been given in the forest, a fleet of one hundred and sixty
      galleys proudly rode at anchor in the sea. 48 under circumstances
      much less favorable, majorian equalled the spirit and
      perseverance of the ancient romans. the woods of the apennine
      were felled; the arsenals and manufactures of ravenna and misenum
      were restored; italy and gaul vied with each other in liberal
      contributions to the public service; and the imperial navy of
      three hundred large galleys, with an adequate proportion of
      transports and smaller vessels, was collected in the secure and
      capacious harbor of carthagena in spain. 49 the intrepid
      countenance of majorian animated his troops with a confidence of
      victory; and, if we might credit the historian procopius, his
      courage sometimes hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence.
      anxious to explore, with his own eyes, the state of the vandals,
      he ventured, after disguising the color of his hair, to visit
      carthage, in the character of his own ambassador: and genseric
      was afterwards mortified by the discovery, that he had
      entertained and dismissed the emperor of the romans. such an
      anecdote may be rejected as an improbable fiction; but it is a
      fiction which would not have been imagined, unless in the life of
      a hero. 50

      chapter xxxvi: total extinction of the western empire.part iii.

      without the help of a personal interview, genseric was
      sufficiently acquainted with the genius and designs of his
      adversary. he practiced his customary arts of fraud and delay,
      but he practiced them without success. his applications for peace
      became each hour more submissive, and perhaps more sincere; but
      the inflexible majorian had adopted the ancient maxim, that rome
      could not be safe, as long as carthage existed in a hostile
      state. the king of the vandals distrusted the valor of his native
      subjects, who were enervated by the luxury of the south; 51 he
      suspected the fidelity of the vanquished people, who abhorred him
      as an arian tyrant; and the desperate measure, which he executed,
      of reducing mauritania into a desert, 52 could not defeat the
      operations of the roman emperor, who was at liberty to land his
      troops on any part of the african coast. but genseric was saved
      from impending and inevitable ruin by the treachery of some
      powerful subjects, envious, or apprehensive, of their masters
      success. guided by their secret intelligence, he surprised the
      unguarded fleet in the bay of carthagena: many of the ships were
      sunk, or taken, or burnt; and the preparations of three years
      were destroyed in a single day. 53 after this event, the behavior
      of the two antagonists showed them superior to their fortune. the
      vandal, instead of being elated by this accidental victory,
      immediately renewed his solicitations for peace. the emperor of
      the west, who was capable of forming great designs, and of
      supporting heavy disappointments, consented to a treaty, or
      rather to a suspension of arms; in the full assurance that,
      before he could restore his navy, he should be supplied with
      provocations to justify a second war. majorian returned to italy,
      to prosecute his labors for the public happiness; and, as he was
      conscious of his own integrity, he might long remain ignorant of
      the dark conspiracy which threatened his throne and his life. the
      recent misfortune of carthagena sullied the glory which had
      dazzled the eyes of the multitude; almost every description of
      civil and military officers were exasperated against the
      reformer, since they all derived some advantage from the abuses
      which he endeavored to suppress; and the patrician ricimer
      impelled the inconstant passions of the barbarians against a
      prince whom he esteemed and hated. the virtues of majorian could
      not protect him from the impetuous sedition, which broke out in
      the camp near tortona, at the foot of the alps. he was compelled
      to abdicate the imperial purple: five days after his abdication,
      it was reported that he died of a dysentery; 54 and the humble
      tomb, which covered his remains, was consecrated by the respect
      and gratitude of succeeding generations. 55 the private character
      of majorian inspired love and respect. malicious calumny and
      satire excited his indignation, or, if he himself were the
      object, his contempt; but he protected the freedom of wit, and,
      in the hours which the emperor gave to the familiar society of
      his friends, he could indulge his taste for pleasantry, without
      degrading the majesty of his rank. 56

      subrisit augustus; ut erat, auctoritate servata, cum se
      communioni dedisset, joci plenus, outweighs the six hundred
      lines of his venal panegyric.]

      it was not, perhaps, without some regret, that ricimer sacrificed
      his friend to the interest of his ambition: but he resolved, in a
      second choice, to avoid the imprudent preference of superior
      virtue and merit. at his command, the obsequious senate of rome
      bestowed the imperial title on libius severus, who ascended the
      throne of the west without emerging from the obscurity of a
      private condition. history has scarcely deigned to notice his
      birth, his elevation, his character, or his death. severus
      expired, as soon as his life became inconvenient to his patron;
      57 and it would be useless to discriminate his nominal reign in
      the vacant interval of six years, between the death of majorian
      and the elevation of anthemius. during that period, the
      government was in the hands of ricimer alone; and, although the
      modest barbarian disclaimed the name of king, he accumulated
      treasures, formed a separate army, negotiated private alliances,
      and ruled italy with the same independent and despotic authority,
      which was afterwards exercised by odoacer and theodoric. but his
      dominions were bounded by the alps; and two roman generals,
      marcellinus and aegidius, maintained their allegiance to the
      republic, by rejecting, with disdain, the phantom which he styled
      an emperor. marcellinus still adhered to the old religion; and
      the devout pagans, who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church
      and state, applauded his profound skill in the science of
      divination. but he possessed the more valuable qualifications of
      learning, virtue, and courage; 58 the study of the latin
      literature had improved his taste; and his military talents had
      recommended him to the esteem and confidence of the great tius,
      in whose ruin he was involved. by a timely flight, marcellinus
      escaped the rage of valentinian, and boldly asserted his liberty
      amidst the convulsions of the western empire. his voluntary, or
      reluctant, submission to the authority of majorian, was rewarded
      by the government of sicily, and the command of an army,
      stationed in that island to oppose, or to attack, the vandals;
      but his barbarian mercenaries, after the emperors death, were
      tempted to revolt by the artful liberality of ricimer. at the
      head of a band of faithful followers, the intrepid marcellinus
      occupied the province of dalmatia, assumed the title of patrician
      of the west, secured the love of his subjects by a mild and
      equitable reign, built a fleet which claimed the dominion of the
      adriatic, and alternately alarmed the coasts of italy and of
      africa. 59 aegidius, the master-general of gaul, who equalled, or
      at least who imitated, the heroes of ancient rome, 60 proclaimed
      his immortal resentment against the assassins of his beloved
      master. a brave and numerous army was attached to his standard:
      and, though he was prevented by the arts of ricimer, and the arms
      of the visigoths, from marching to the gates of rome, he
      maintained his independent sovereignty beyond the alps, and
      rendered the name of aegidius, respectable both in peace and war.
      the franks, who had punished with exile the youthful follies of
      childeric, elected the roman general for their king: his vanity,
      rather than his ambition, was gratified by that singular honor;
      and when the nation, at the end of four years, repented of the
      injury which they had offered to the merovingian family, he
      patiently acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful prince. the
      authority of aegidius ended only with his life, and the
      suspicions of poison and secret violence, which derived some

      the kingdom of italy, a name to which the western empire was
      gradually reduced, was afflicted, under the reign of ricimer, by
      the incessant depredations of the vandal pirates. 62 in the
      spring of each year, they equipped a formidable navy in the port
      of carthage; and genseric himself, though in a very advanced age,
      still commanded in person the most important expeditions. his
      designs were concealed with impenetrable secrecy, till the moment
      that he hoisted sail. when he was asked, by his pilot, what
      course he should steer, leave the determination to the winds,
      (replied the barbarian, with pious arrogance;) they will
      transport us to the guilty coast, whose inhabitants have provoked
      the divine justice; but if genseric himself deigned to issue
      more precise orders, he judged the most wealthy to be the most
      criminal. the vandals repeatedly visited the coasts of spain,
      liguria, tuscany, campania, lucania, bruttium, apulia, calabria,
      venetia, dalmatia, epirus, greece, and sicily: they were tempted
      to subdue the island of sardinia, so advantageously placed in the
      centre of the mediterranean; and their arms spread desolation, or
      terror, from the columns of hercules to the mouth of the nile. as
      they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory, they seldom
      attacked any fortified cities, or engaged any regular troops in
      the open field. but the celerity of their motions enabled them,
      almost at the same time, to threaten and to attack the most
      distant objects, which attracted their desires; and as they
      always embarked a sufficient number of horses, they had no sooner
      landed, than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light
      cavalry. yet, notwithstanding the example of their king, the
      native vandals and alani insensibly declined this toilsome and
      perilous warfare; the hardy generation of the first conquerors
      was almost extinguished, and their sons, who were born in africa,
      enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired
      by the valor of their fathers. their place was readily supplied
      by a various multitude of moors and romans, of captives and
      outlaws; and those desperate wretches, who had already violated
      the laws of their country, were the most eager to promote the
      atrocious acts which disgrace the victories of genseric. in the
      treatment of his unhappy prisoners, he sometimes consulted his
      avarice, and sometimes indulged his cruelty; and the massacre of
      five hundred noble citizens of zant or zacynthus, whose mangled
      bodies he cast into the ionian sea, was imputed, by the public
      indignation, to his latest posterity.

      by his subject, and expresses a strong idea by a lively image:

     quotannis militat excidium; conversoque ordine fati torrida
     caucaseos infert mihi byrsa furores]

      such crimes could not be excused by any provocations; but the
      war, which the king of the vandals prosecuted against the roman
      empire was justified by a specious and reasonable motive. the
      widow of valentinian, eudoxia, whom he had led captive from rome
      to carthage, was the sole heiress of the theodosian house; her
      elder daughter, eudocia, became the reluctant wife of hunneric,
      his eldest son; and the stern father, asserting a legal claim,
      which could not easily be refuted or satisfied, demanded a just
      proportion of the imperial patrimony. an adequate, or at least a
      valuable, compensation, was offered by the eastern emperor, to
      purchase a necessary peace. eudoxia and her younger daughter,
      placidia, were honorably restored, and the fury of the vandals
      was confined to the limits of the western empire. the italians,
      destitute of a naval force, which alone was capable of protecting
      their coasts, implored the aid of the more fortunate nations of
      the east; who had formerly acknowledged, in peace and war, the
      supremacy of rome. but the perpetual divisions of the two empires
      had alienated their interest and their inclinations; the faith of
      a recent treaty was alleged; and the western romans, instead of
      arms and ships, could only obtain the assistance of a cold and
      ineffectual mediation. the haughty ricimer, who had long
      struggled with the difficulties of his situation, was at length
      reduced to address the throne of constantinople, in the humble
      language of a subject; and italy submitted, as the price and
      security of the alliance, to accept a master from the choice of
      the emperor of the east. 63 it is not the purpose of the present
      chapter, or even of the present volume, to continue the distinct
      series of the byzantine history; but a concise view of the reign
      and character of the emperor leo, may explain the last efforts
      that were attempted to save the falling empire of the west. 64

      solicitation of the river god, transports herself to
      constantinople, renounces her ancient claims, and implores the
      friendship of aurora, the goddess of the east. this fabulous
      machinery, which the genius of claudian had used and abused, is
      the constant and miserable resource of the muse of sidonius.]

      and zeno, are reduced to some imperfect fragments, whose
      deficiencies must be supplied from the more recent compilations
      of theophanes, zonaras, and cedrenus.]

      since the death of the younger theodosius, the domestic repose of
      constantinople had never been interrupted by war or faction.
      pulcheria had bestowed her hand, and the sceptre of the east, on
      the modest virtue of marcian: he gratefully reverenced her august
      rank and virgin chastity; and, after her death, he gave his
      people the example of the religious worship that was due to the
      memory of the imperial saint. 65 attentive to the prosperity of
      his own dominions, marcian seemed to behold, with indifference,
      the misfortunes of rome; and the obstinate refusal of a brave and
      active prince, to draw his sword against the vandals, was
      ascribed to a secret promise, which had formerly been exacted
      from him when he was a captive in the power of genseric. 66 the
      death of marcian, after a reign of seven years, would have
      exposed the east to the danger of a popular election; if the
      superior weight of a single family had not been able to incline
      the balance in favor of the candidate whose interest they
      supported. the patrician aspar might have placed the diadem on
      his own head, if he would have subscribed the nicene creed. 67
      during three generations, the armies of the east were
      successively commanded by his father, by himself, and by his son
      ardaburius; his barbarian guards formed a military force that
      overawed the palace and the capital; and the liberal distribution
      of his immense treasures rendered aspar as popular as he was
      powerful. he recommended the obscure name of leo of thrace, a
      military tribune, and the principal steward of his household. his
      nomination was unanimously ratified by the senate; and the
      servant of aspar received the imperial crown from the hands of
      the patriarch or bishop, who was permitted to express, by this
      unusual ceremony, the suffrage of the deity. 68 this emperor, the
      first of the name of leo, has been distinguished by the title of
      the great; from a succession of princes, who gradually fixed in
      the opinion of the greeks a very humble standard of heroic, or at
      least of royal, perfection. yet the temperate firmness with which
      leo resisted the oppression of his benefactor, showed that he was
      conscious of his duty and of his prerogative. aspar was
      astonished to find that his influence could no longer appoint a
      prfect of constantinople: he presumed to reproach his sovereign
      with a breach of promise, and insolently shaking his purple, it
      is not proper, (said he,) that the man who is invested with this
      garment, should be guilty of lying. nor is it proper, (replied
      leo,) that a prince should be compelled to resign his own
      judgment, and the public interest, to the will of a subject.69
      after this extraordinary scene, it was impossible that the
      reconciliation of the emperor and the patrician could be sincere;
      or, at least, that it could be solid and permanent. an army of
      isaurians 70 was secretly levied, and introduced into
      constantinople; and while leo undermined the authority, and
      prepared the disgrace, of the family of aspar, his mild and
      cautious behavior restrained them from any rash and desperate
      attempts, which might have been fatal to themselves, or their
      enemies. the measures of peace and war were affected by this
      internal revolution. as long as aspar degraded the majesty of the
      throne, the secret correspondence of religion and interest
      engaged him to favor the cause of genseric. when leo had
      delivered himself from that ignominious servitude, he listened to
      the complaints of the italians; resolved to extirpate the tyranny
      of the vandals; and declared his alliance with his colleague,
      anthemius, whom he solemnly invested with the diadem and purple
      of the west.

      empire in the two succeeding reigns of zeno and anastasius; but

      their fierce independences about two hundred and thirty years.]

      the virtues of anthemius have perhaps been magnified, since the
      imperial descent, which he could only deduce from the usurper
      procopius, has been swelled into a line of emperors. 71 but the
      merit of his immediate parents, their honors, and their riches,
      rendered anthemius one of the most illustrious subjects of the
      east. his father, procopius, obtained, after his persian embassy,
      the rank of general and patrician; and the name of anthemius was
      derived from his maternal grandfather, the celebrated prfect,
      who protected, with so much ability and success, the infant reign
      of theodosius. the grandson of the prfect was raised above the
      condition of a private subject, by his marriage with euphemia,
      the daughter of the emperor marcian. this splendid alliance,
      which might supersede the necessity of merit, hastened the
      promotion of anthemius to the successive dignities of count, of
      master-general, of consul, and of patrician; and his merit or
      fortune claimed the honors of a victory, which was obtained on
      the banks of the danube, over the huns. without indulging an
      extravagant ambition, the son-in-law of marcian might hope to be
      his successor; but anthemius supported the disappointment with
      courage and patience; and his subsequent elevation was
      universally approved by the public, who esteemed him worthy to
      reign, till he ascended the throne. 72 the emperor of the west
      marched from constantinople, attended by several counts of high
      distinction, and a body of guards almost equal to the strength
      and numbers of a regular army: he entered rome in triumph, and
      the choice of leo was confirmed by the senate, the people, and
      the barbarian confederates of italy. 73 the solemn inauguration
      of anthemius was followed by the nuptials of his daughter and the
      patrician ricimer; a fortunate event, which was considered as the
      firmest security of the union and happiness of the state. the
      wealth of two empires was ostentatiously displayed; and many
      senators completed their ruin, by an expensive effort to disguise
      their poverty. all serious business was suspended during this
      festival; the courts of justice were shut; the streets of rome,
      the theatres, the places of public and private resort, resounded
      with hymeneal songs and dances: and the royal bride, clothed in
      silken robes, with a crown on her head, was conducted to the
      palace of ricimer, who had changed his military dress for the
      habit of a consul and a senator. on this memorable occasion,
      sidonius, whose early ambition had been so fatally blasted,
      appeared as the orator of auvergne, among the provincial deputies
      who addressed the throne with congratulations or complaints. 74
      the calends of january were now approaching, and the venal poet,
      who had loved avitus, and esteemed majorian, was persuaded by his
      friends to celebrate, in heroic verse, the merit, the felicity,
      the second consulship, and the future triumphs, of the emperor
      anthemius. sidonius pronounced, with assurance and success, a
      panegyric which is still extant; and whatever might be the
      imperfections, either of the subject or of the composition, the
      welcome flatterer was immediately rewarded with the prfecture
      of rome; a dignity which placed him among the illustrious
      personages of the empire, till he wisely preferred the more
      respectable character of a bishop and a saint. 75

      the greeks ambitiously commend the piety and catholic faith of
      the emperor whom they gave to the west; nor do they forget to
      observe, that when he left constantinople, he converted his
      palace into the pious foundation of a public bath, a church, and
      a hospital for old men. 76 yet some suspicious appearances are
      found to sully the theological fame of anthemius. from the
      conversation of philotheus, a macedonian sectary, he had imbibed
      the spirit of religious toleration; and the heretics of rome
      would have assembled with impunity, if the bold and vehement
      censure which pope hilary pronounced in the church of st. peter,
      had not obliged him to abjure the unpopular indulgence. 77 even
      the pagans, a feeble and obscure remnant, conceived some vain
      hopes, from the indifference, or partiality, of anthemius; and
      his singular friendship for the philosopher severus, whom he
      promoted to the consulship, was ascribed to a secret project, of
      reviving the ancient worship of the gods. 78 these idols were
      crumbled into dust: and the mythology which had once been the
      creed of nations, was so universally disbelieved, that it might
      be employed without scandal, or at least without suspicion, by
      christian poets. 79 yet the vestiges of superstition were not
      absolutely obliterated, and the festival of the lupercalia, whose
      origin had preceded the foundation of rome, was still celebrated
      under the reign of anthemius. the savage and simple rites were
      expressive of an early state of society before the invention of
      arts and agriculture. the rustic deities who presided over the
      toils and pleasures of the pastoral life, pan, faunus, and their
      train of satyrs, were such as the fancy of shepherds might
      create, sportive, petulant, and lascivious; whose power was
      limited, and whose malice was inoffensive. a goat was the
      offering the best adapted to their character and attributes; the
      flesh of the victim was roasted on willow spits; and the riotous
      youths, who crowded to the feast, ran naked about the fields,
      with leather thongs in their hands, communicating, as it was
      supposed, the blessing of fecundity to the women whom they
      touched. 80 the altar of pan was erected, perhaps by evander the
      arcadian, in a dark recess in the side of the palantine hill,
      watered by a perpetual fountain, and shaded by a hanging grove. a
      tradition, that, in the same place, romulus and remus were
      suckled by the wolf, rendered it still more sacred and venerable
      in the eyes of the romans; and this sylvan spot was gradually
      surrounded by the stately edifices of the forum. 81 after the
      conversion of the imperial city, the christians still continued,
      in the month of february, the annual celebration of the
      lupercalia; to which they ascribed a secret and mysterious
      influence on the genial powers of the animal and vegetable world.

      the bishops of rome were solicitous to abolish a profane custom,
      so repugnant to the spirit of christianity; but their zeal was
      not supported by the authority of the civil magistrate: the
      inveterate abuse subsisted till the end of the fifth century, and
      pope gelasius, who purified the capital from the last stain of
      idolatry, appeased by a formal apology, the murmurs of the senate
      and people. 82

      chapter xxxvi: total extinction of the western empire.part iv.

      in all his public declarations, the emperor leo assumes the
      authority, and professes the affection, of a father, for his son
      anthemius, with whom he had divided the administration of the
      universe. 83 the situation, and perhaps the character, of leo,
      dissuaded him from exposing his person to the toils and dangers
      of an african war. but the powers of the eastern empire were
      strenuously exerted to deliver italy and the mediterranean from
      the vandals; and genseric, who had so long oppressed both the
      land and sea, was threatened from every side with a formidable
      invasion. the campaign was opened by a bold and successful
      enterprise of the prfect heraclius. 84 the troops of egypt,
      thebais, and libya, were embarked, under his command; and the
      arabs, with a train of horses and camels, opened the roads of the
      desert. heraclius landed on the coast of tripoli, surprised and
      subdued the cities of that province, and prepared, by a laborious
      march, which cato had formerly executed, 85 to join the imperial
      army under the walls of carthage. the intelligence of this loss
      extorted from genseric some insidious and ineffectual
      propositions of peace; but he was still more seriously alarmed by
      the reconciliation of marcellinus with the two empires. the
      independent patrician had been persuaded to acknowledge the
      legitimate title of anthemius, whom he accompanied in his journey
      to rome; the dalmatian fleet was received into the harbors of
      italy; the active valor of marcellinus expelled the vandals from
      the island of sardinia; and the languid efforts of the west added
      some weight to the immense preparations of the eastern romans.
      the expense of the naval armament, which leo sent against the
      vandals, has been distinctly ascertained; and the curious and
      instructive account displays the wealth of the declining empire.
      the royal demesnes, or private patrimony of the prince, supplied
      seventeen thousand pounds of gold; forty-seven thousand pounds of
      gold, and seven hundred thousand of silver, were levied and paid
      into the treasury by the prtorian prfects. but the cities
      were reduced to extreme poverty; and the diligent calculation of
      fines and forfeitures, as a valuable object of the revenue, does
      not suggest the idea of a just or merciful administration. the
      whole expense, by whatsoever means it was defrayed, of the
      african campaign, amounted to the sum of one hundred and thirty
      thousand pounds of gold, about five millions two hundred thousand
      pounds sterling, at a time when the value of money appears, from
      the comparative price of corn, to have been somewhat higher than
      in the present age. 86 the fleet that sailed from constantinople
      to carthage, consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships, and
      the number of soldiers and mariners exceeded one hundred thousand
      men. basiliscus, the brother of the empress vorina, was intrusted
      with this important command. his sister, the wife of leo, had
      exaggerated the merit of his former exploits against the
      scythians. but the discovery of his guilt, or incapacity, was
      reserved for the african war; and his friends could only save his
      military reputation by asserting, that he had conspired with
      aspar to spare genseric, and to betray the last hope of the
      western empire.

      are less certain, and less important. the historian malchus
      laments the public misery, (excerpt. ex suida in corp. hist.

      hoarding the treasures which he extorted from the people. * note:

      at 65,000 lbs. of gold, 700,000 of silver. but lydus exaggerates
      the fleet to the incredible number of 10,000 long ships,
      (liburnae,) and the troops to 400,000 men. lydus describes this
      fatal measure, of which he charges the blame on basiliscus, as
      the shipwreck of the state. from that time all the revenues of
      the empire were anticipated; and the finances fell into
      inextricable confusion.m.]

      experience has shown, that the success of an invader most
      commonly depends on the vigor and celerity of his operations. the
      strength and sharpness of the first impression are blunted by
      delay; the health and spirit of the troops insensibly languish in
      a distant climate; the naval and military force, a mighty effort
      which perhaps can never be repeated, is silently consumed; and
      every hour that is wasted in negotiation, accustoms the enemy to
      contemplate and examine those hostile terrors, which, on their
      first appearance, he deemed irresistible. the formidable navy of
      basiliscus pursued its prosperous navigation from the thracian
      bosphorus to the coast of africa. he landed his troops at cape
      bona, or the promontory of mercury, about forty miles from
      carthage. 87 the army of heraclius, and the fleet of marcellinus,
      either joined or seconded the imperial lieutenant; and the
      vandals who opposed his progress by sea or land, were
      successively vanquished. 88 if basiliscus had seized the moment
      of consternation, and boldly advanced to the capital, carthage
      must have surrendered, and the kingdom of the vandals was
      extinguished. genseric beheld the danger with firmness, and
      eluded it with his veteran dexterity. he protested, in the most
      respectful language, that he was ready to submit his person, and
      his dominions, to the will of the emperor; but he requested a
      truce of five days to regulate the terms of his submission; and
      it was universally believed, that his secret liberality
      contributed to the success of this public negotiation. instead of
      obstinately refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so earnestly
      solicited, the guilty, or the credulous, basiliscus consented to
      the fatal truce; and his imprudent security seemed to proclaim,
      that he already considered himself as the conqueror of africa.
      during this short interval, the wind became favorable to the
      designs of genseric. he manned his largest ships of war with the
      bravest of the moors and vandals; and they towed after them many
      large barks, filled with combustible materials. in the obscurity
      of the night, these destructive vessels were impelled against the
      unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of the romans, who were awakened
      by the sense of their instant danger. their close and crowded
      order assisted the progress of the fire, which was communicated
      with rapid and irresistible violence; and the noise of the wind,
      the crackling of the flames, the dissonant cries of the soldiers
      and mariners, who could neither command nor obey, increased the
      horror of the nocturnal tumult. whilst they labored to extricate
      themselves from the fire-ships, and to save at least a part of
      the navy, the galleys of genseric assaulted them with temperate
      and disciplined valor; and many of the romans, who escaped the
      fury of the flames, were destroyed or taken by the victorious
      vandals. among the events of that disastrous night, the heroic,
      or rather desperate, courage of john, one of the principal
      officers of basiliscus, has rescued his name from oblivion. when
      the ship, which he had bravely defended, was almost consumed, he
      threw himself in his armor into the sea, disdainfully rejected
      the esteem and pity of genso, the son of genseric, who pressed
      him to accept honorable quarter, and sunk under the waves;
      exclaiming, with his last breath, that he would never fall alive
      into the hands of those impious dogs. actuated by a far different
      spirit, basiliscus, whose station was the most remote from
      danger, disgracefully fled in the beginning of the engagement,
      returned to constantinople with the loss of more than half of his
      fleet and army, and sheltered his guilty head in the sanctuary of
      st. sophia, till his sister, by her tears and entreaties, could
      obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor. heraclius effected
      his retreat through the desert; marcellinus retired to sicily,
      where he was assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of ricimer,
      by one of his own captains; and the king of the vandals expressed
      his surprise and satisfaction, that the romans themselves should
      remove from the world his most formidable antagonists. 89 after
      the failure of this great expedition, 891 genseric again became
      the tyrant of the sea: the coasts of italy, greece, and asia,
      were again exposed to his revenge and avarice; tripoli and
      sardinia returned to his obedience; he added sicily to the number
      of his provinces; and before he died, in the fulness of years and
      of glory, he beheld the final extinction of the empire of the
      west. 90

      tom. iii. p. 497) has made a judicious observation on the failure
      of these great naval armaments.]

      during his long and active reign, the african monarch had
      studiously cultivated the friendship of the barbarians of europe,
      whose arms he might employ in a seasonable and effectual
      diversion against the two empires. after the death of attila, he
      renewed his alliance with the visigoths of gaul; and the sons of
      the elder theodoric, who successively reigned over that warlike
      nation, were easily persuaded, by the sense of interest, to
      forget the cruel affront which genseric had inflicted on their
      sister. 91 the death of the emperor majorian delivered theodoric
      the second from the restraint of fear, and perhaps of honor; he
      violated his recent treaty with the romans; and the ample
      territory of narbonne, which he firmly united to his dominions,
      became the immediate reward of his perfidy. the selfish policy of
      ricimer encouraged him to invade the provinces which were in the
      possession of aegidius, his rival; but the active count, by the
      defence of arles, and the victory of orleans, saved gaul, and
      checked, during his lifetime, the progress of the visigoths.
      their ambition was soon rekindled; and the design of
      extinguishing the roman empire in spain and gaul was conceived,
      and almost completed, in the reign of euric, who assassinated his
      brother theodoric, and displayed, with a more savage temper,
      superior abilities, both in peace and war. he passed the pyrenees
      at the head of a numerous army, subdued the cities of saragossa
      and pampeluna, vanquished in battle the martial nobles of the
      tarragonese province, carried his victorious arms into the heart
      of lusitania, and permitted the suevi to hold the kingdom of
      gallicia under the gothic monarchy of spain. 92 the efforts of
      euric were not less vigorous, or less successful, in gaul; and
      throughout the country that extends from the pyrenees to the
      rhone and the loire, berry and auvergne were the only cities, or
      dioceses, which refused to acknowledge him as their master. 93 in
      the defence of clermont, their principal town, the inhabitants of
      auvergne sustained, with inflexible resolution, the miseries of
      war, pestilence, and famine; and the visigoths, relinquishing the
      fruitless siege, suspended the hopes of that important conquest.
      the youth of the province were animated by the heroic, and almost
      incredible, valor of ecdicius, the son of the emperor avitus, 94
      who made a desperate sally with only eighteen horsemen, boldly
      attacked the gothic army, and, after maintaining a flying
      skirmish, retired safe and victorious within the walls of
      clermont. his charity was equal to his courage: in a time of
      extreme scarcity, four thousand poor were fed at his expense; and
      his private influence levied an army of burgundians for the
      deliverance of auvergne. from his virtues alone the faithful
      citizens of gaul derived any hopes of safety or freedom; and even
      such virtues were insufficient to avert the impending ruin of
      their country, since they were anxious to learn, from his
      authority and example, whether they should prefer the alternative
      of exile or servitude. 95 the public confidence was lost; the
      resources of the state were exhausted; and the gauls had too much
      reason to believe, that anthemius, who reigned in italy, was
      incapable of protecting his distressed subjects beyond the alps.
      the feeble emperor could only procure for their defence the
      service of twelve thousand british auxiliaries. riothamus, one of
      the independent kings, or chieftains, of the island, was
      persuaded to transport his troops to the continent of gaul: he
      sailed up the loire, and established his quarters in berry, where
      the people complained of these oppressive allies, till they were
      destroyed or dispersed by the arms of the visigoths. 96

      one of the last acts of jurisdiction, which the roman senate
      exercised over their subjects of gaul, was the trial and
      condemnation of arvandus, the prtorian prfect. sidonius, who
      rejoices that he lived under a reign in which he might pity and
      assist a state criminal, has expressed, with tenderness and
      freedom, the faults of his indiscreet and unfortunate friend. 97
      from the perils which he had escaped, arvandus imbibed confidence
      rather than wisdom; and such was the various, though uniform,
      imprudence of his behavior, that his prosperity must appear much
      more surprising than his downfall. the second prfecture, which
      he obtained within the term of five years, abolished the merit
      and popularity of his preceding administration. his easy temper
      was corrupted by flattery, and exasperated by opposition; he was
      forced to satisfy his importunate creditors with the spoils of
      the province; his capricious insolence offended the nobles of
      gaul, and he sunk under the weight of the public hatred. the
      mandate of his disgrace summoned him to justify his conduct
      before the senate; and he passed the sea of tuscany with a
      favorable wind, the presage, as he vainly imagined, of his future
      fortunes. a decent respect was still observed for the
      proefectorian rank; and on his arrival at rome, arvandus was
      committed to the hospitality, rather than to the custody, of
      flavius asellus, the count of the sacred largesses, who resided
      in the capitol. 98 he was eagerly pursued by his accusers, the
      four deputies of gaul, who were all distinguished by their birth,
      their dignities, or their eloquence. in the name of a great
      province, and according to the forms of roman jurisprudence, they
      instituted a civil and criminal action, requiring such
      restitution as might compensate the losses of individuals, and
      such punishment as might satisfy the justice of the state. their
      charges of corrupt oppression were numerous and weighty; but they
      placed their secret dependence on a letter which they had
      intercepted, and which they could prove, by the evidence of his
      secretary, to have been dictated by arvandus himself. the author
      of this letter seemed to dissuade the king of the goths from a
      peace with the greek emperor: he suggested the attack of the
      britons on the loire; and he recommended a division of gaul,
      according to the law of nations, between the visigoths and the
      burgundians. 99 these pernicious schemes, which a friend could
      only palliate by the reproaches of vanity and indiscretion, were
      susceptible of a treasonable interpretation; and the deputies had
      artfully resolved not to produce their most formidable weapons
      till the decisive moment of the contest. but their intentions
      were discovered by the zeal of sidonius. he immediately apprised
      the unsuspecting criminal of his danger; and sincerely lamented,
      without any mixture of anger, the haughty presumption of
      arvandus, who rejected, and even resented, the salutary advice of
      his friends. ignorant of his real situation, arvandus showed
      himself in the capitol in the white robe of a candidate, accepted
      indiscriminate salutations and offers of service, examined the
      shops of the merchants, the silks and gems, sometimes with the
      indifference of a spectator, and sometimes with the attention of
      a purchaser; and complained of the times, of the senate, of the
      prince, and of the delays of justice. his complaints were soon
      removed. an early day was fixed for his trial; and arvandus
      appeared, with his accusers, before a numerous assembly of the
      roman senate. the mournful garb which they affected, excited the
      compassion of the judges, who were scandalized by the gay and
      splendid dress of their adversary: and when the prfect
      arvandus, with the first of the gallic deputies, were directed to
      take their places on the senatorial benches, the same contrast of
      pride and modesty was observed in their behavior. in this
      memorable judgment, which presented a lively image of the old
      republic, the gauls exposed, with force and freedom, the
      grievances of the province; and as soon as the minds of the
      audience were sufficiently inflamed, they recited the fatal
      epistle. the obstinacy of arvandus was founded on the strange
      supposition, that a subject could not be convicted of treason,
      unless he had actually conspired to assume the purple. as the
      paper was read, he repeatedly, and with a loud voice,
      acknowledged it for his genuine composition; and his astonishment
      was equal to his dismay, when the unanimous voice of the senate
      declared him guilty of a capital offence. by their decree, he was
      degraded from the rank of a prfect to the obscure condition of
      a plebeian, and ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the
      public prison. after a fortnights adjournment, the senate was
      again convened to pronounce the sentence of his death; but while
      he expected, in the island of aesculapius, the expiration of the
      thirty days allowed by an ancient law to the vilest malefactors,
      100 his friends interposed, the emperor anthemius relented, and
      the prfect of gaul obtained the milder punishment of exile and
      confiscation. the faults of arvandus might deserve compassion;

      republic, till he was condemned and executed, on the complaint of

      his age and country, held a secret correspondence with the
      visigoths, to betray the province which he oppressed: his
      industry was continually exercised in the discovery of new taxes
      and obsolete offences; and his extravagant vices would have
      inspired contempt, if they had not excited fear and abhorrence.

      such criminals were not beyond the reach of justice; but whatever
      might be the guilt of ricimer, that powerful barbarian was able
      to contend or to negotiate with the prince, whose alliance he had
      condescended to accept. the peaceful and prosperous reign which
      anthemius had promised to the west, was soon clouded by
      misfortune and discord. ricimer, apprehensive, or impatient, of a
      superior, retired from rome, and fixed his residence at milan; an
      advantageous situation either to invite or to repel the warlike
      tribes that were seated between the alps and the danube. 102
      italy was gradually divided into two independent and hostile
      kingdoms; and the nobles of liguria, who trembled at the near
      approach of a civil war, fell prostrate at the feet of the
      patrician, and conjured him to spare their unhappy country. for
      my own part, replied ricimer, in a tone of insolent moderation,
      i am still inclined to embrace the friendship of the galatian;
      103 but who will undertake to appease his anger, or to mitigate
      the pride, which always rises in proportion to our submission?
      they informed him, that epiphanius, bishop of pavia, 104 united
      the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove; and
      appeared confident, that the eloquence of such an ambassador must
      prevail against the strongest opposition, either of interest or
      passion. their recommendation was approved; and epiphanius,
      assuming the benevolent office of mediation, proceeded without
      delay to rome, where he was received with the honors due to his
      merit and reputation. the oration of a bishop in favor of peace
      may be easily supposed; he argued, that, in all possible
      circumstances, the forgiveness of injuries must be an act of
      mercy, or magnanimity, or prudence; and he seriously admonished
      the emperor to avoid a contest with a fierce barbarian, which
      might be fatal to himself, and must be ruinous to his dominions.
      anthemius acknowledged the truth of his maxims; but he deeply
      felt, with grief and indignation, the behavior of ricimer, and
      his passion gave eloquence and energy to his discourse. what
      favors, he warmly exclaimed, have we refused to this ungrateful
      man? what provocations have we not endured! regardless of the
      majesty of the purple, i gave my daughter to a goth; i sacrificed
      my own blood to the safety of the republic. the liberality which
      ought to have secured the eternal attachment of ricimer has
      exasperated him against his benefactor. what wars has he not
      excited against the empire! how often has he instigated and
      assisted the fury of hostile nations! shall i now accept his
      perfidious friendship? can i hope that he will respect the
      engagements of a treaty, who has already violated the duties of a
      son? but the anger of anthemius evaporated in these passionate
      exclamations: he insensibly yielded to the proposals of
      epiphanius; and the bishop returned to his diocese with the
      satisfaction of restoring the peace of italy, by a
      reconciliation, 105 of which the sincerity and continuance might
      be reasonably suspected. the clemency of the emperor was extorted
      from his weakness; and ricimer suspended his ambitious designs
      till he had secretly prepared the engines with which he resolved
      to subvert the throne of anthemius. the mask of peace and
      moderation was then thrown aside. the army of ricimer was
      fortified by a numerous reenforcement of burgundians and oriental
      suevi: he disclaimed all allegiance to the greek emperor, marched
      from milan to the gates of rome, and fixing his camp on the banks
      of the anio, impatiently expected the arrival of olybrius, his
      imperial candidate.

      western empire.]

      the senator olybrius, of the anician family, might esteem himself
      the lawful heir of the western empire. he had married placidia,
      the younger daughter of valentinian, after she was restored by
      genseric; who still detained her sister eudoxia, as the wife, or
      rather as the captive, of his son. the king of the vandals
      supported, by threats and solicitations, the fair pretensions of
      his roman ally; and assigned, as one of the motives of the war,
      the refusal of the senate and people to acknowledge their lawful
      prince, and the unworthy preference which they had given to a
      stranger. 106 the friendship of the public enemy might render
      olybrius still more unpopular to the italians; but when ricimer
      meditated the ruin of the emperor anthemius, he tempted, with the
      offer of a diadem, the candidate who could justify his rebellion
      by an illustrious name and a royal alliance. the husband of
      placidia, who, like most of his ancestors, had been invested with
      the consular dignity, might have continued to enjoy a secure and
      splendid fortune in the peaceful residence of constantinople; nor
      does he appear to have been tormented by such a genius as cannot
      be amused or occupied, unless by the administration of an empire.
      yet olybrius yielded to the importunities of his friends, perhaps
      of his wife; rashly plunged into the dangers and calamities of a
      civil war; and, with the secret connivance of the emperor leo,
      accepted the italian purple, which was bestowed, and resumed, at
      the capricious will of a barbarian. he landed without obstacle
      (for genseric was master of the sea) either at ravenna, or the
      port of ostia, and immediately proceeded to the camp of ricimer,
      where he was received as the sovereign of the western world. 107

      this obscure period, our ignorance extends to the most public and

      the patrician, who had extended his posts from the anio to the
      melvian bridge, already possessed two quarters of rome, the
      vatican and the janiculum, which are separated by the tyber from
      the rest of the city; 108 and it may be conjectured, that an
      assembly of seceding senators imitated, in the choice of
      olybrius, the forms of a legal election. but the body of the
      senate and people firmly adhered to the cause of anthemius; and
      the more effectual support of a gothic army enabled him to
      prolong his reign, and the public distress, by a resistance of
      three months, which produced the concomitant evils of famine and
      pestilence. at length ricimer made a furious assault on the
      bridge of hadrian, or st. angelo; and the narrow pass was
      defended with equal valor by the goths, till the death of
      gilimer, their leader. the victorious troops, breaking down every
      barrier, rushed with irresistible violence into the heart of the
      city, and rome (if we may use the language of a contemporary
      pope) was subverted by the civil fury of anthemius and ricimer.
      109 the unfortunate anthemius was dragged from his concealment,
      and inhumanly massacred by the command of his son-in-law; who
      thus added a third, or perhaps a fourth, emperor to the number of
      his victims. the soldiers, who united the rage of factious
      citizens with the savage manners of barbarians, were indulged,
      without control, in the license of rapine and murder: the crowd
      of slaves and plebeians, who were unconcerned in the event, could
      only gain by the indiscriminate pillage; and the face of the city
      exhibited the strange contrast of stern cruelty and dissolute
      intemperance. 110 forty days after this calamitous event, the
      subject, not of glory, but of guilt, italy was delivered, by a
      painful disease, from the tyrant ricimer, who bequeathed the
      command of his army to his nephew gundobald, one of the princes
      of the burgundians. in the same year all the principal actors in
      this great revolution were removed from the stage; and the whole
      reign of olybrius, whose death does not betray any symptoms of
      violence, is included within the term of seven months. he left
      one daughter, the offspring of his marriage with placidia; and
      the family of the great theodosius, transplanted from spain to
      constantinople, was propagated in the female line as far as the
      eighth generation. 111

      chapter xxxvi: total extinction of the western empire.part v.

      whilst the vacant throne of italy was abandoned to lawless
      barbarians, 112 the election of a new colleague was seriously
      agitated in the council of leo. the empress verina, studious to
      promote the greatness of her own family, had married one of her
      nieces to julius nepos, who succeeded his uncle marcellinus in
      the sovereignty of dalmatia, a more solid possession than the
      title which he was persuaded to accept, of emperor of the west.
      but the measures of the byzantine court were so languid and
      irresolute, that many months elapsed after the death of
      anthemius, and even of olybrius, before their destined successor
      could show himself, with a respectable force, to his italian
      subjects. during that interval, glycerius, an obscure soldier,
      was invested with the purple by his patron gundobald; but the
      burgundian prince was unable, or unwilling, to support his
      nomination by a civil war: the pursuits of domestic ambition
      recalled him beyond the alps, 113 and his client was permitted to
      exchange the roman sceptre for the bishopric of salona. after
      extinguishing such a competitor, the emperor nepos was
      acknowledged by the senate, by the italians, and by the
      provincials of gaul; his moral virtues, and military talents,
      were loudly celebrated; and those who derived any private benefit
      from his government, announced, in prophetic strains, the
      restoration of the public felicity. 114 their hopes (if such
      hopes had been entertained) were confounded within the term of a
      single year, and the treaty of peace, which ceded auvergue to the
      visigoths, is the only event of his short and inglorious reign.
      the most faithful subjects of gaul were sacrificed, by the
      italian emperor, to the hope of domestic security; 115 but his
      repose was soon invaded by a furious sedition of the barbarian
      confederates, who, under the command of orestes, their general,
      were in full march from rome to ravenna. nepos trembled at their
      approach; and, instead of placing a just confidence in the
      strength of ravenna, he hastily escaped to his ships, and retired
      to his dalmatian principality, on the opposite coast of the
      adriatic. by this shameful abdication, he protracted his life
      about five years, in a very ambiguous state, between an emperor
      and an exile, till he was assassinated at salona by the
      ungrateful glycerius, who was translated, perhaps as the reward
      of his crime, to the archbishopric of milan. 116

      the nations who had asserted their independence after the death
      of attila, were established, by the right of possession or
      conquest, in the boundless countries to the north of the danube;
      or in the roman provinces between the river and the alps. but the
      bravest of their youth enlisted in the army of confederates, who
      formed the defence and the terror of italy; 117 and in this
      promiscuous multitude, the names of the heruli, the scyrri, the
      alani, the turcilingi, and the rugians, appear to have
      predominated. the example of these warriors was imitated by
      orestes, 118 the son of tatullus, and the father of the last
      roman emperor of the west. orestes, who has been already
      mentioned in this history, had never deserted his country. his
      birth and fortunes rendered him one of the most illustrious
      subjects of pannonia. when that province was ceded to the huns,
      he entered into the service of attila, his lawful sovereign,
      obtained the office of his secretary, and was repeatedly sent
      ambassador to constantinople, to represent the person, and
      signify the commands, of the imperious monarch. the death of that
      conqueror restored him to his freedom; and orestes might
      honorably refuse either to follow the sons of attila into the
      scythian desert, or to obey the ostrogoths, who had usurped the
      dominion of pannonia. he preferred the service of the italian
      princes, the successors of valentinian; and as he possessed the
      qualifications of courage, industry, and experience, he advanced
      with rapid steps in the military profession, till he was
      elevated, by the favor of nepos himself, to the dignities of
      patrician, and master-general of the troops. these troops had
      been long accustomed to reverence the character and authority of
      orestes, who affected their manners, conversed with them in their
      own language, and was intimately connected with their national
      chieftains, by long habits of familiarity and friendship. at his
      solicitation they rose in arms against the obscure greek, who
      presumed to claim their obedience; and when orestes, from some
      secret motive, declined the purple, they consented, with the same
      facility, to acknowledge his son augustulus as the emperor of the
      west. by the abdication of nepos, orestes had now attained the
      summit of his ambitious hopes; but he soon discovered, before the
      end of the first year, that the lessons of perjury and
      ingratitude, which a rebel must inculcate, will be resorted to
      against himself; and that the precarious sovereign of italy was
      only permitted to choose, whether he would be the slave, or the
      victim, of his barbarian mercenaries. the dangerous alliance of
      these strangers had oppressed and insulted the last remains of
      roman freedom and dignity. at each revolution, their pay and
      privileges were augmented; but their insolence increased in a
      still more extravagant degree; they envied the fortune of their
      brethren in gaul, spain, and africa, whose victorious arms had
      acquired an independent and perpetual inheritance; and they
      insisted on their peremptory demand, that a third part of the
      lands of italy should be immediately divided among them. orestes,
      with a spirit, which, in another situation, might be entitled to
      our esteem, chose rather to encounter the rage of an armed
      multitude, than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people. he
      rejected the audacious demand; and his refusal was favorable to
      the ambition of odoacer; a bold barbarian, who assured his
      fellow-soldiers, that, if they dared to associate under his
      command, they might soon extort the justice which had been denied
      to their dutiful petitions. from all the camps and garrisons of
      italy, the confederates, actuated by the same resentment and the
      same hopes, impatiently flocked to the standard of this popular
      leader; and the unfortunate patrician, overwhelmed by the
      torrent, hastily retreated to the strong city of pavia, the
      episcopal seat of the holy epiphanites. pavia was immediately
      besieged, the fortifications were stormed, the town was pillaged;
      and although the bishop might labor, with much zeal and some
      success, to save the property of the church, and the chastity of
      female captives, the tumult could only be appeased by the
      execution of orestes. 119 his brother paul was slain in an action
      near ravenna; and the helpless augustulus, who could no longer
      command the respect, was reduced to implore the clemency, of
      odoacer.

      historians, represent odoacer in the false light of a stranger,

      native subjects.]

      remarkable transactions, particularly described in a preceding
      chapter, had been the colleague of orestes himself. 1191 the
      honor of an ambassador should be exempt from suspicion; and

      sovereign. but this apparent guilt was expiated by his merit or
      repentance; his rank was eminent and conspicuous; he enjoyed the
      favor of attila; and the troops under his command, who guarded,
      in their turn, the royal village, consisted of a tribe of scyrri,
      his immediate and hereditary subjects. in the revolt of the
      nations, they still adhered to the huns; and more than twelve
      years afterwards, the name of edecon is honorably mentioned, in
      their unequal contests with the ostrogoths; which was terminated,
      after two bloody battles, by the defeat and dispersion of the
      scyrri. 120 their gallant leader, who did not survive this
      national calamity, left two sons, onulf and odoacer, to struggle
      with adversity, and to maintain as they might, by rapine or
      service, the faithful followers of their exile. onulf directed
      his steps towards constantinople, where he sullied, by the
      assassination of a generous benefactor, the fame which he had
      acquired in arms. his brother odoacer led a wandering life among
      the barbarians of noricum, with a mind and a fortune suited to
      the most desperate adventures; and when he had fixed his choice,
      he piously visited the cell of severinus, the popular saint of
      the country, to solicit his approbation and blessing. the lowness
      of the door would not admit the lofty stature of odoacer: he was
      obliged to stoop; but in that humble attitude the saint could
      discern the symptoms of his future greatness; and addressing him
      in a prophetic tone, pursue (said he) your design; proceed to
      italy; you will soon cast away this coarse garment of skins; and
      your wealth will be adequate to the liberality of your mind. 121
      the barbarian, whose daring spirit accepted and ratified the
      prediction, was admitted into the service of the western empire,
      and soon obtained an honorable rank in the guards. his manners
      were gradually polished, his military skill was improved, and the
      confederates of italy would not have elected him for their
      general, unless the exploits of odoacer had established a high
      opinion of his courage and capacity. 122 their military
      acclamations saluted him with the title of king; but he
      abstained, during his whole reign, from the use of the purple and
      diadem, 123 lest he should offend those princes, whose subjects,
      by their accidental mixture, had formed the victorious army,
      which time and policy might insensibly unite into a great nation.

      royalty was familiar to the barbarians, and the submissive people
      of italy was prepared to obey, without a murmur, the authority
      which he should condescend to exercise as the vicegerent of the
      emperor of the west. but odoacer had resolved to abolish that
      useless and expensive office; and such is the weight of antique
      prejudice, that it required some boldness and penetration to
      discover the extreme facility of the enterprise. the unfortunate
      augustulus was made the instrument of his own disgrace: he
      signified his resignation to the senate; and that assembly, in
      their last act of obedience to a roman prince, still affected the
      spirit of freedom, and the forms of the constitution. an epistle
      was addressed, by their unanimous decree, to the emperor zeno,
      the son-in-law and successor of leo; who had lately been
      restored, after a short rebellion, to the byzantine throne. they
      solemnly disclaim the necessity, or even the wish, of continuing
      any longer the imperial succession in italy; since, in their
      opinion, the majesty of a sole monarch is sufficient to pervade
      and protect, at the same time, both the east and the west. in
      their own name, and in the name of the people, they consent that
      the seat of universal empire shall be transferred from rome to
      constantinople; and they basely renounce the right of choosing
      their master, the only vestige that yet remained of the authority
      which had given laws to the world. the republic (they repeat that
      name without a blush) might safely confide in the civil and
      military virtues of odoacer; and they humbly request, that the
      emperor would invest him with the title of patrician, and the
      administration of the diocese of italy. the deputies of the
      senate were received at constantinople with some marks of
      displeasure and indignation: and when they were admitted to the
      audience of zeno, he sternly reproached them with their treatment
      of the two emperors, anthemius and nepos, whom the east had
      successively granted to the prayers of italy. the first
      (continued he) you have murdered; the second you have expelled;
      but the second is still alive, and whilst he lives he is your
      lawful sovereign. but the prudent zeno soon deserted the
      hopeless cause of his abdicated colleague. his vanity was
      gratified by the title of sole emperor, and by the statues
      erected to his honor in the several quarters of rome; he
      entertained a friendly, though ambiguous, correspondence with the
      patrician odoacer; and he gratefully accepted the imperial
      ensigns, the sacred ornaments of the throne and palace, which the
      barbarian was not unwilling to remove from the sight of the
      people. 124

      in the space of twenty years since the death of valentinian, nine
      emperors had successively disappeared; and the son of orestes, a
      youth recommended only by his beauty, would be the least entitled
      to the notice of posterity, if his reign, which was marked by the
      extinction of the roman empire in the west, did not leave a
      memorable era in the history of mankind. 125 the patrician
      orestes had married the daughter of count romulus, of petovio in
      noricum: the name of augustus, notwithstanding the jealousy of
      power, was known at aquileia as a familiar surname; and the
      appellations of the two great founders, of the city and of the
      monarchy, were thus strangely united in the last of their
      successors. 126 the son of orestes assumed and disgraced the
      names of romulus augustus; but the first was corrupted into
      momyllus, by the greeks, and the second has been changed by the
      latins into the contemptible diminutive augustulus. the life of
      this inoffensive youth was spared by the generous clemency of
      odoacer; who dismissed him, with his whole family, from the
      imperial palace, fixed his annual allowance at six thousand
      pieces of gold, and assigned the castle of lucullus, in campania,
      for the place of his exile or retirement. 127 as soon as the
      romans breathed from the toils of the punic war, they were
      attracted by the beauties and the pleasures of campania; and the
      country-house of the elder scipio at liternum exhibited a lasting
      model of their rustic simplicity. 128 the delicious shores of the
      bay of naples were crowded with villas; and sylla applauded the
      masterly skill of his rival, who had seated himself on the lofty
      promontory of misenum, that commands, on every side, the sea and
      land, as far as the boundaries of the horizon. 129 the villa of
      marius was purchased, within a few years, by lucullus, and the
      price had increased from two thousand five hundred, to more than
      fourscore thousand, pounds sterling. 130 it was adorned by the
      new proprietor with grecian arts and asiatic treasures; and the
      houses and gardens of lucullus obtained a distinguished rank in
      the list of imperial palaces. 131 when the vandals became
      formidable to the sea-coast, the lucullan villa, on the
      promontory of misenum, gradually assumed the strength and
      appellation of a strong castle, the obscure retreat of the last
      emperor of the west. about twenty years after that great
      revolution, it was converted into a church and monastery, to
      receive the bones of st. severinus. they securely reposed, amidst
      the the broken trophies of cimbric and armenian victories,till

      odoacer was the first barbarian who reigned in italy, over a
      people who had once asserted their just superiority above the
      rest of mankind. the disgrace of the romans still excites our
      respectful compassion, and we fondly sympathize with the
      imaginary grief and indignation of their degenerate posterity.
      but the calamities of italy had gradually subdued the proud
      consciousness of freedom and glory. in the age of roman virtue
      the provinces were subject to the arms, and the citizens to the
      laws, of the republic; till those laws were subverted by civil
      discord, and both the city and the province became the servile
      property of a tyrant. the forms of the constitution, which
      alleviated or disguised their abject slavery, were abolished by
      time and violence; the italians alternately lamented the presence
      or the absence of the sovereign, whom they detested or despised;
      and the succession of five centuries inflicted the various evils
      of military license, capricious despotism, and elaborate
      oppression. during the same period, the barbarians had emerged
      from obscurity and contempt, and the warriors of germany and
      scythia were introduced into the provinces, as the servants, the
      allies, and at length the masters, of the romans, whom they
      insulted or protected. the hatred of the people was suppressed by
      fear; they respected the spirit and splendor of the martial
      chiefs who were invested with the honors of the empire; and the
      fate of rome had long depended on the sword of those formidable
      strangers. the stern ricimer, who trampled on the ruins of italy,
      had exercised the power, without assuming the title, of a king;
      and the patient romans were insensibly prepared to acknowledge
      the royalty of odoacer and his barbaric successors. the king of
      italy was not unworthy of the high station to which his valor and
      fortune had exalted him: his savage manners were polished by the
      habits of conversation; and he respected, though a conqueror and
      a barbarian, the institutions, and even the prejudices, of his
      subjects. after an interval of seven years, odoacer restored the
      consulship of the west. for himself, he modestly, or proudly,
      declined an honor which was still accepted by the emperors of the
      east; but the curule chair was successively filled by eleven of
      the most illustrious senators; 133 and the list is adorned by the
      respectable name of basilius, whose virtues claimed the
      friendship and grateful applause of sidonius, his client. 134 the
      laws of the emperors were strictly enforced, and the civil
      administration of italy was still exercised by the prtorian
      prfect and his subordinate officers. odoacer devolved on the
      roman magistrates the odious and oppressive task of collecting
      the public revenue; but he reserved for himself the merit of
      seasonable and popular indulgence. 135 like the rest of the
      barbarians, he had been instructed in the arian heresy; but he
      revered the monastic and episcopal characters; and the silence of
      the catholics attest the toleration which they enjoyed. the peace
      of the city required the interposition of his prfect basilius
      in the choice of a roman pontiff: the decree which restrained the
      clergy from alienating their lands was ultimately designed for
      the benefit of the people, whose devotions would have been taxed
      to repair the dilapidations of the church. 136 italy was
      protected by the arms of its conqueror; and its frontiers were
      respected by the barbarians of gaul and germany, who had so long
      insulted the feeble race of theodosius. odoacer passed the
      adriatic, to chastise the assassins of the emperor nepos, and to
      acquire the maritime province of dalmatia. he passed the alps, to
      rescue the remains of noricum from fava, or feletheus, king of
      the rugians, who held his residence beyond the danube. the king
      was vanquished in battle, and led away prisoner; a numerous
      colony of captives and subjects was transplanted into italy; and
      rome, after a long period of defeat and disgrace, might claim the
      triumph of her barbarian master. 137

      antiquities]

      notwithstanding the prudence and success of odoacer, his kingdom
      exhibited the sad prospect of misery and desolation. since the
      age of tiberius, the decay of agriculture had been felt in italy;
      and it was a just subject of complaint, that the life of the
      roman people depended on the accidents of the winds and waves.
      138 in the division and the decline of the empire, the tributary
      harvests of egypt and africa were withdrawn; the numbers of the
      inhabitants continually diminished with the means of subsistence;
      and the country was exhausted by the irretrievable losses of war,
      famine, 139 and pestilence. st. ambrose has deplored the ruin of
      a populous district, which had been once adorned with the
      flourishing cities of bologna, modena, regium, and placentia. 140
      pope gelasius was a subject of odoacer; and he affirms, with
      strong exaggeration, that in aemilia, tuscany, and the adjacent
      provinces, the human species was almost extirpated. 141 the
      plebeians of rome, who were fed by the hand of their master,
      perished or disappeared, as soon as his liberality was
      suppressed; the decline of the arts reduced the industrious
      mechanic to idleness and want; and the senators, who might
      support with patience the ruin of their country, bewailed their
      private loss of wealth and luxury. 1411 one third of those ample
      estates, to which the ruin of italy is originally imputed, 142
      was extorted for the use of the conquerors. injuries were
      aggravated by insults; the sense of actual sufferings was
      imbittered by the fear of more dreadful evils; and as new lands
      were allotted to the new swarms of barbarians, each senator was
      apprehensive lest the arbitrary surveyors should approach his
      favorite villa, or his most profitable farm. the least
      unfortunate were those who submitted without a murmur to the
      power which it was impossible to resist. since they desired to
      live, they owed some gratitude to the tyrant who had spared their
      lives; and since he was the absolute master of their fortunes,
      the portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and
      voluntary gift. 143 the distress of italy 1431 was mitigated by
      the prudence and humanity of odoacer, who had bound himself, as
      the price of his elevation, to satisfy the demands of a
      licentious and turbulent multitude. the kings of the barbarians
      were frequently resisted, deposed, or murdered, by their native
      subjects, and the various bands of italian mercenaries, who
      associated under the standard of an elective general, claimed a
      larger privilege of freedom and rapine. a monarchy destitute of
      national union, and hereditary right, hastened to its
      dissolution. after a reign of fourteen years, odoacer was
      oppressed by the superior genius of theodoric, king of the
      ostrogoths; a hero alike excellent in the arts of war and of
      government, who restored an age of peace and prosperity, and
      whose name still excites and deserves the attention of mankind.

      the indissoluble connection of civil and ecclesiastical affairs
      has compelled, and encouraged, me to relate the progress, the
      persecutions, the establishment, the divisions, the final
      triumph, and the gradual corruption, of christianity. i have
      purposely delayed the consideration of two religious events,
      interesting in the study of human nature, and important in the
      decline and fall of the roman empire. i. the institution of the
      monastic life; 1 and, ii. the conversion of the northern
      barbarians.

      1 (return) [ the origin of the monastic institution has been

      full extent. yet the cautious protestant, who distrusts any
      popish guides, may consult the seventh book of binghams
      christian antiquities.]

      i. prosperity and peace introduced the distinction of the vulgar
      and the ascetic christians. 2 the loose and imperfect practice of
      religion satisfied the conscience of the multitude. the prince or
      magistrate, the soldier or merchant, reconciled their fervent
      zeal, and implicit faith, with the exercise of their profession,
      the pursuit of their interest, and the indulgence of their
      passions: but the ascetics, who obeyed and abused the rigid
      precepts of the gospel, were inspired by the savage enthusiasm
      which represents man as a criminal, and god as a tyrant. they
      seriously renounced the business, and the pleasures, of the age;
      abjured the use of wine, of flesh, and of marriage; chastised
      their body, mortified their affections, and embraced a life of
      misery, as the price of eternal happiness. in the reign of
      constantine, the ascetics fled from a profane and degenerate
      world, to perpetual solitude, or religious society. like the
      first christians of jerusalem, 3 311 they resigned the use, or
      the property of their temporal possessions; established regular
      communities of the same sex, and a similar disposition; and
      assumed the names of hermits, monks, and anachorets, expressive
      of their lonely retreat in a natural or artificial desert. they
      soon acquired the respect of the world, which they despised; and
      the loudest applause was bestowed on this divine philosophy, 4
      which surpassed, without the aid of science or reason, the
      laborious virtues of the grecian schools. the monks might indeed
      contend with the stoics, in the contempt of fortune, of pain, and
      of death: the pythagorean silence and submission were revived in
      their servile discipline; and they disdained, as firmly as the
      cynics themselves, all the forms and decencies of civil society.
      but the votaries of this divine philosophy aspired to imitate a
      purer and more perfect model. they trod in the footsteps of the
      prophets, who had retired to the desert; 5 and they restored the
      devout and contemplative life, which had been instituted by the
      essenians, in palestine and egypt. the philosophic eye of pliny
      had surveyed with astonishment a solitary people, who dwelt among
      the palm-trees near the dead sea; who subsisted without money,
      who were propagated without women; and who derived from the
      disgust and repentance of mankind a perpetual supply of voluntary
      associates. 6

      egypt, the fruitful parent of superstition, afforded the first
      example of the monastic life. antony, 7 an illiterate 8 youth of
      the lower parts of thebais, distributed his patrimony, 9 deserted
      his family and native home, and executed his monastic penance
      with original and intrepid fanaticism. after a long and painful
      novitiate, among the tombs, and in a ruined tower, he boldly
      advanced into the desert three days journey to the eastward of
      the nile; discovered a lonely spot, which possessed the
      advantages of shade and water, and fixed his last residence on
      mount colzim, near the red sea; where an ancient monastery still
      preserves the name and memory of the saint. 10 the curious
      devotion of the christians pursued him to the desert; and when he
      was obliged to appear at alexandria, in the face of mankind, he
      supported his fame with discretion and dignity. he enjoyed the
      friendship of athanasius, whose doctrine he approved; and the
      egyptian peasant respectfully declined a respectful invitation
      from the emperor constantine. the venerable patriarch (for antony
      attained the age of one hundred and five years) beheld the
      numerous progeny which had been formed by his example and his
      lessons. the prolific colonies of monks multiplied with rapid
      increase on the sands of libya, upon the rocks of thebais, and in
      the cities of the nile. to the south of alexandria, the mountain,
      and adjacent desert, of nitria, were peopled by five thousand
      anachorets; and the traveller may still investigate the ruins of
      fifty monasteries, which were planted in that barren soil by the
      disciples of antony. 11 in the upper thebais, the vacant island
      of tabenne, 12 was occupied by pachomius and fourteen hundred of
      his brethren. that holy abbot successively founded nine
      monasteries of men, and one of women; and the festival of easter
      sometimes collected fifty thousand religious persons, who
      followed his angelic rule of discipline. 13 the stately and
      populous city of oxyrinchus, the seat of christian orthodoxy, had
      devoted the temples, the public edifices, and even the ramparts,
      to pious and charitable uses; and the bishop, who might preach in
      twelve churches, computed ten thousand females and twenty
      thousand males, of the monastic profession. 14 the egyptians, who
      gloried in this marvellous revolution, were disposed to hope, and
      to believe, that the number of the monks was equal to the
      remainder of the people; 15 and posterity might repeat the
      saying, which had formerly been applied to the sacred animals of
      the same country, that in egypt it was less difficult to find a
      god than a man.

      athanasius introduced into rome the knowledge and practice of the
      monastic life; and a school of this new philosophy was opened by
      the disciples of antony, who accompanied their primate to the
      holy threshold of the vatican. the strange and savage appearance
      of these egyptians excited, at first, horror and contempt, and,
      at length, applause and zealous imitation. the senators, and more
      especially the matrons, transformed their palaces and villas into
      religious houses; and the narrow institution of six vestals was
      eclipsed by the frequent monasteries, which were seated on the
      ruins of ancient temples, and in the midst of the roman forum. 16
      inflamed by the example of antony, a syrian youth, whose name was
      hilarion, 17 fixed his dreary abode on a sandy beach, between the
      sea and a morass, about seven miles from gaza. the austere
      penance, in which he persisted forty-eight years, diffused a
      similar enthusiasm; and the holy man was followed by a train of
      two or three thousand anachorets, whenever he visited the
      innumerable monasteries of palestine. the fame of basil 18 is
      immortal in the monastic history of the east. with a mind that
      had tasted the learning and eloquence of athens; with an ambition
      scarcely to be satisfied with the archbishopric of caesarea,
      basil retired to a savage solitude in pontus; and deigned, for a
      while, to give laws to the spiritual colonies which he profusely
      scattered along the coast of the black sea. in the west, martin
      of tours, 19 a soldier, a hermit, a bishop, and a saint,
      established the monasteries of gaul; two thousand of his
      disciples followed him to the grave; and his eloquent historian
      challenges the deserts of thebais to produce, in a more favorable
      climate, a champion of equal virtue. the progress of the monks
      was not less rapid, or universal, than that of christianity
      itself. every province, and, at last, every city, of the empire,
      was filled with their increasing multitudes; and the bleak and
      barren isles, from lerins to lipari, that arose out of the tuscan
      sea, were chosen by the anachorets for the place of their
      voluntary exile. an easy and perpetual intercourse by sea and
      land connected the provinces of the roman world; and the life of
      hilarion displays the facility with which an indigent hermit of
      palestine might traverse egypt, embark for sicily, escape to
      epirus, and finally settle in the island of cyprus. 20 the latin
      christians embraced the religious institutions of rome. the
      pilgrims, who visited jerusalem, eagerly copied, in the most
      distant climates of the earth, the faithful model of the monastic
      life. the disciples of antony spread themselves beyond the
      tropic, over the christian empire of thiopia. 21 the monastery
      of banchor, 22 in flintshire, which contained above two thousand
      brethren, dispersed a numerous colony among the barbarians of
      ireland; 23 and iona, one of the hebrides, which was planted by
      the irish monks, diffused over the northern regions a doubtful
      ray of science and superstition. 24

      these unhappy exiles from social life were impelled by the dark
      and implacable genius of superstition. their mutual resolution
      was supported by the example of millions, of either sex, of every
      age, and of every rank; and each proselyte who entered the gates
      of a monastery, was persuaded that he trod the steep and thorny
      path of eternal happiness. 25 but the operation of these
      religious motives was variously determined by the temper and
      situation of mankind. reason might subdue, or passion might
      suspend, their influence: but they acted most forcibly on the
      infirm minds of children and females; they were strengthened by
      secret remorse, or accidental misfortune; and they might derive
      some aid from the temporal considerations of vanity or interest.
      it was naturally supposed, that the pious and humble monks, who
      had renounced the world to accomplish the work of their
      salvation, were the best qualified for the spiritual government
      of the christians. the reluctant hermit was torn from his cell,
      and seated, amidst the acclamations of the people, on the
      episcopal throne: the monasteries of egypt, of gaul, and of the
      east, supplied a regular succession of saints and bishops; and
      ambition soon discovered the secret road which led to the
      possession of wealth and honors. 26 the popular monks, whose
      reputation was connected with the fame and success of the order,
      assiduously labored to multiply the number of their
      fellow-captives. they insinuated themselves into noble and
      opulent families; and the specious arts of flattery and seduction
      were employed to secure those proselytes who might bestow wealth
      or dignity on the monastic profession. the indignant father
      bewailed the loss, perhaps, of an only son; 27 the credulous maid
      was betrayed by vanity to violate the laws of nature; and the
      matron aspired to imaginary perfection, by renouncing the virtues
      of domestic life. paula yielded to the persuasive eloquence of
      jerom; 28 and the profane title of mother-in-law of god 29
      tempted that illustrious widow to consecrate the virginity of her
      daughter eustochium. by the advice, and in the company, of her
      spiritual guide, paula abandoned rome and her infant son; retired
      to the holy village of bethlem; founded a hospital and four
      monasteries; and acquired, by her alms and penance, an eminent
      and conspicuous station in the catholic church. such rare and
      illustrious penitents were celebrated as the glory and example of
      their age; but the monasteries were filled by a crowd of obscure
      and abject plebeians, 30 who gained in the cloister much more
      than they had sacrificed in the world. peasants, slaves, and
      mechanics, might escape from poverty and contempt to a safe and
      honorable profession; whose apparent hardships are mitigated by
      custom, by popular applause, and by the secret relaxation of
      discipline. 31 the subjects of rome, whose persons and fortunes
      were made responsible for unequal and exorbitant tributes,
      retired from the oppression of the imperial government; and the
      pusillanimous youth preferred the penance of a monastic, to the
      dangers of a military, life. the affrighted provincials of every
      rank, who fled before the barbarians, found shelter and
      subsistence: whole legions were buried in these religious
      sanctuaries; and the same cause, which relieved the distress of
      individuals, impaired the strength and fortitude of the empire.

      the monastic profession of the ancients 33 was an act of
      voluntary devotion. the inconstant fanatic was threatened with
      the eternal vengeance of the god whom he deserted; but the doors
      of the monastery were still open for repentance. those monks,
      whose conscience was fortified by reason or passion, were at
      liberty to resume the character of men and citizens; and even the
      spouses of christ might accept the legal embraces of an earthly
      lover. 34 the examples of scandal, and the progress of
      superstition, suggested the propriety of more forcible
      restraints. after a sufficient trial, the fidelity of the novice
      was secured by a solemn and perpetual vow; and his irrevocable
      engagement was ratified by the laws of the church and state. a
      guilty fugitive was pursued, arrested, and restored to his
      perpetual prison; and the interposition of the magistrate
      oppressed the freedom and the merit, which had alleviated, in
      some degree, the abject slavery of the monastic discipline. 35
      the actions of a monk, his words, and even his thoughts, were
      determined by an inflexible rule, 36 or a capricious superior:
      the slightest offences were corrected by disgrace or confinement,
      extraordinary fasts, or bloody flagellation; and disobedience,
      murmur, or delay, were ranked in the catalogue of the most
      heinous sins. 37 a blind submission to the commands of the abbot,
      however absurd, or even criminal, they might seem, was the ruling
      principle, the first virtue of the egyptian monks; and their
      patience was frequently exercised by the most extravagant trials.
      they were directed to remove an enormous rock; assiduously to
      water a barren staff, that was planted in the ground, till, at
      the end of three years, it should vegetate and blossom like a
      tree; to walk into a fiery furnace; or to cast their infant into
      a deep pond: and several saints, or madmen, have been
      immortalized in monastic story, by their thoughtless and fearless
      obedience. 38 the freedom of the mind, the source of every
      generous and rational sentiment, was destroyed by the habits of
      credulity and submission; and the monk, contracting the vices of
      a slave, devoutly followed the faith and passions of his
      ecclesiastical tyrant. the peace of the eastern church was
      invaded by a swarm of fanatics, incapable of fear, or reason, or
      humanity; and the imperial troops acknowledged, without shame,
      that they were much less apprehensive of an encounter with the
      fiercest barbarians. 39

      superstition has often framed and consecrated the fantastic
      garments of the monks: 40 but their apparent singularity
      sometimes proceeds from their uniform attachment to a simple and
      primitive model, which the revolutions of fashion have made
      ridiculous in the eyes of mankind. the father of the benedictines
      expressly disclaims all idea of choice of merit; and soberly
      exhorts his disciples to adopt the coarse and convenient dress of
      the countries which they may inhabit. 41 the monastic habits of
      the ancients varied with the climate, and their mode of life; and
      they assumed, with the same indifference, the sheep-skin of the
      egyptian peasants, or the cloak of the grecian philosophers. they
      allowed themselves the use of linen in egypt, where it was a
      cheap and domestic manufacture; but in the west they rejected
      such an expensive article of foreign luxury. 42 it was the
      practice of the monks either to cut or shave their hair; they
      wrapped their heads in a cowl to escape the sight of profane
      objects; their legs and feet were naked, except in the extreme
      cold of winter; and their slow and feeble steps were supported by
      a long staff. the aspect of a genuine anachoret was horrid and
      disgusting: every sensation that is offensive to man was thought
      acceptable to god; and the angelic rule of tabenne condemned the
      salutary custom of bathing the limbs in water, and of anointing
      them with oil. 43 431 the austere monks slept on the ground, on a
      hard mat, or a rough blanket; and the same bundle of palm-leaves
      served them as a seat in the day, and a pillow in the night.
      their original cells were low, narrow huts, built of the
      slightest materials; which formed, by the regular distribution of
      the streets, a large and populous village, enclosing, within the
      common wall, a church, a hospital, perhaps a library, some
      necessary offices, a garden, and a fountain or reservoir of fresh
      water. thirty or forty brethren composed a family of separate

      pleasure and guilt are synonymous terms in the language of the
      monks, and they discovered, by experience, that rigid fasts, and
      abstemious diet, are the most effectual preservatives against the
      impure desires of the flesh. 44 the rules of abstinence which
      they imposed, or practised, were not uniform or perpetual: the
      cheerful festival of the pentecost was balanced by the
      extraordinary mortification of lent; the fervor of new
      monasteries was insensibly relaxed; and the voracious appetite of
      the gauls could not imitate the patient and temperate virtue of
      the egyptians. 45 the disciples of antony and pachomius were
      satisfied with their daily pittance, 46 of twelve ounces of
      bread, or rather biscuit, 47 which they divided into two frugal
      repasts, of the afternoon and of the evening. it was esteemed a
      merit, and almost a duty, to abstain from the boiled vegetables
      which were provided for the refectory; but the extraordinary
      bounty of the abbot sometimes indulged them with the luxury of
      cheese, fruit, salad, and the small dried fish of the nile. 48 a
      more ample latitude of sea and river fish was gradually allowed
      or assumed; but the use of flesh was long confined to the sick or
      travellers; and when it gradually prevailed in the less rigid
      monasteries of europe, a singular distinction was introduced; as
      if birds, whether wild or domestic, had been less profane than
      the grosser animals of the field. water was the pure and innocent
      beverage of the primitive monks; and the founder of the
      benedictines regrets the daily portion of half a pint of wine,
      which had been extorted from him by the intemperance of the age.
      49 such an allowance might be easily supplied by the vineyards of
      italy; and his victorious disciples, who passed the alps, the
      rhine, and the baltic, required, in the place of wine, an
      adequate compensation of strong beer or cider.

      the candidate who aspired to the virtue of evangelical poverty,
      abjured, at his first entrance into a regular community, the
      idea, and even the name, of all separate or exclusive
      possessions. 50 the brethren were supported by their manual
      labor; and the duty of labor was strenuously recommended as a
      penance, as an exercise, and as the most laudable means of
      securing their daily subsistence. 51 the garden and fields, which
      the industry of the monks had often rescued from the forest or
      the morass, were diligently cultivated by their hands. they
      performed, without reluctance, the menial offices of slaves and
      domestics; and the several trades that were necessary to provide
      their habits, their utensils, and their lodging, were exercised
      within the precincts of the great monasteries. the monastic
      studies have tended, for the most part, to darken, rather than to
      dispel, the cloud of superstition. yet the curiosity or zeal of
      some learned solitaries has cultivated the ecclesiastical, and
      even the profane, sciences; and posterity must gratefully
      acknowledge, that the monuments of greek and roman literature
      have been preserved and multiplied by their indefatigable pens.
      52 but the more humble industry of the monks, especially in
      egypt, was contented with the silent, sedentary occupation of
      making wooden sandals, or of twisting the leaves of the palm-tree
      into mats and baskets. the superfluous stock, which was not
      consumed in domestic use, supplied, by trade, the wants of the
      community: the boats of tabenne, and the other monasteries of
      thebais, descended the nile as far as alexandria; and, in a

      receive, for their use, any future accessions of legacy or
      inheritance. 53 melania contributed her plate, three hundred
      pounds weight of silver; and paula contracted an immense debt,
      for the relief of their favorite monks; who kindly imparted the
      merits of their prayers and penance to a rich and liberal sinner.
      54 time continually increased, and accidents could seldom
      diminish, the estates of the popular monasteries, which spread
      over the adjacent country and cities: and, in the first century
      of their institution, the infidel zosimus has maliciously
      observed, that, for the benefit of the poor, the christian monks
      had reduced a great part of mankind to a state of beggary. 55 as
      long as they maintained their original fervor, they approved
      themselves, however, the faithful and benevolent stewards of the
      charity, which was entrusted to their care. but their discipline
      was corrupted by prosperity: they gradually assumed the pride of
      wealth, and at last indulged the luxury of expense. their public
      luxury might be excused by the magnificence of religious worship,
      and the decent motive of erecting durable habitations for an
      immortal society. but every age of the church has accused the
      licentiousness of the degenerate monks; who no longer remembered
      the object of their institution, embraced the vain and sensual
      pleasures of the world, which they had renounced, 56 and
      scandalously abused the riches which had been acquired by the
      austere virtues of their founders. 57 their natural descent, from
      such painful and dangerous virtue, to the common vices of
      humanity, will not, perhaps, excite much grief or indignation in

      social beings. whenever they were permitted to step beyond the
      precincts of the monastery, two jealous companions were the
      mutual guards and spies of each others actions; and, after their
      return, they were condemned to forget, or, at least, to suppress,
      whatever they had seen or heard in the world. strangers, who
      professed the orthodox faith, were hospitably entertained in a
      separate apartment; but their dangerous conversation was
      restricted to some chosen elders of approved discretion and
      fidelity. except in their presence, the monastic slave might not
      receive the visits of his friends or kindred; and it was deemed
      highly meritorious, if he afflicted a tender sister, or an aged
      parent, by the obstinate refusal of a word or look. 58 the monks
      themselves passed their lives, without personal attachments,
      among a crowd which had been formed by accident, and was
      detained, in the same prison, by force or prejudice. recluse
      fanatics have few ideas or sentiments to communicate: a special
      license of the abbot regulated the time and duration of their
      familiar visits; and, at their silent meals, they were enveloped
      in their cowls, inaccessible, and almost invisible, to each
      other. 59 study is the resource of solitude: but education had
      not prepared and qualified for any liberal studies the mechanics
      and peasants who filled the monastic communities. they might
      work: but the vanity of spiritual perfection was tempted to
      disdain the exercise of manual labor; and the industry must be
      faint and languid, which is not excited by the sense of personal
      interest.

      according to their faith and zeal, they might employ the day,
      which they passed in their cells, either in vocal or mental
      prayer: they assembled in the evening, and they were awakened in
      the night, for the public worship of the monastery. the precise
      moment was determined by the stars, which are seldom clouded in
      the serene sky of egypt; and a rustic horn, or trumpet, the
      signal of devotion, twice interrupted the vast silence of the
      desert. 60 even sleep, the last refuge of the unhappy, was
      rigorously measured: the vacant hours of the monk heavily rolled
      along, without business or pleasure; and, before the close of
      each day, he had repeatedly accused the tedious progress of the
      sun. 61 in this comfortless state, superstition still pursued and
      tormented her wretched votaries. 62 the repose which they had
      sought in the cloister was disturbed by a tardy repentance,
      profane doubts, and guilty desires; and, while they considered
      each natural impulse as an unpardonable sin, they perpetually
      trembled on the edge of a flaming and bottomless abyss. from the
      painful struggles of disease and despair, these unhappy victims
      were sometimes relieved by madness or death; and, in the sixth
      century, a hospital was founded at jerusalem for a small portion
      of the austere penitents, who were deprived of their senses. 63
      their visions, before they attained this extreme and acknowledged
      term of frenzy, have afforded ample materials of supernatural
      history. it was their firm persuasion, that the air, which they
      breathed, was peopled with invisible enemies; with innumerable
      demons, who watched every occasion, and assumed every form, to
      terrify, and above all to tempt, their unguarded virtue. the
      imagination, and even the senses, were deceived by the illusions
      of distempered fanaticism; and the hermit, whose midnight prayer
      was oppressed by involuntary slumber, might easily confound the
      phantoms of horror or delight, which had occupied his sleeping
      and his waking dreams. 64

      the monks were divided into two classes: the coenobites, who
      lived under a common and regular discipline; and the anachorets,
      who indulged their unsocial, independent fanaticism. 65 the most
      devout, or the most ambitious, of the spiritual brethren,
      renounced the convent, as they had renounced the world. the
      fervent monasteries of egypt, palestine, and syria, were
      surrounded by a laura, 66 a distant circle of solitary cells; and
      the extravagant penance of hermits was stimulated by applause and
      emulation. 67 they sunk under the painful weight of crosses and
      chains; and their emaciated limbs were confined by collars,
      bracelets, gauntlets, and greaves of massy and rigid iron. all
      superfluous encumbrance of dress they contemptuously cast away;
      and some savage saints of both sexes have been admired, whose
      naked bodies were only covered by their long hair. they aspired
      to reduce themselves to the rude and miserable state in which the
      human brute is scarcely distinguishable above his kindred
      animals; and the numerous sect of anachorets derived their name
      from their humble practice of grazing in the fields of
      mesopotamia with the common herd. 68 they often usurped the den
      of some wild beast whom they affected to resemble; they buried
      themselves in some gloomy cavern, which art or nature had scooped
      out of the rock; and the marble quarries of thebais are still
      inscribed with the monuments of their penance. 69 the most
      perfect hermits are supposed to have passed many days without
      food, many nights without sleep, and many years without speaking;
      and glorious was the man ( i abuse that name) who contrived any

      among these heroes of the monastic life, the name and genius of
      simeon stylites 70 have been immortalized by the singular
      invention of an aerial penance. at the age of thirteen, the young
      syrian deserted the profession of a shepherd, and threw himself
      into an austere monastery. after a long and painful novitiate, in
      which simeon was repeatedly saved from pious suicide, he
      established his residence on a mountain, about thirty or forty
      miles to the east of antioch. within the space of a mandra, or
      circle of stones, to which he had attached himself by a ponderous
      chain, he ascended a column, which was successively raised from
      the height of nine, to that of sixty, feet from the ground. 71 in
      this last and lofty station, the syrian anachoret resisted the
      heat of thirty summers, and the cold of as many winters. habit
      and exercise instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation
      without fear or giddiness, and successively to assume the
      different postures of devotion. he sometimes prayed in an erect
      attitude, with his outstretched arms in the figure of a cross,
      but his most familiar practice was that of bending his meagre
      skeleton from the forehead to the feet; and a curious spectator,
      after numbering twelve hundred and forty-four repetitions, at
      length desisted from the endless account. the progress of an
      ulcer in his thigh 72 might shorten, but it could not disturb,
      this celestial life; and the patient hermit expired, without
      descending from his column. a prince, who should capriciously
      inflict such tortures, would be deemed a tyrant; but it would
      surpass the power of a tyrant to impose a long and miserable
      existence on the reluctant victims of his cruelty. this voluntary
      martyrdom must have gradually destroyed the sensibility both of
      the mind and body; nor can it be presumed that the fanatics, who
      torment themselves, are susceptible of any lively affection for
      the rest of mankind. a cruel, unfeeling temper has distinguished
      the monks of every age and country: their stern indifference,
      which is seldom mollified by personal friendship, is inflamed by
      religious hatred; and their merciless zeal has strenuously
      administered the holy office of the inquisition.

      concerning the origin of this ulcer. it has been reported that
      the devil, assuming an angelic form, invited him to ascend, like
      elijah, into a fiery chariot. the saint too hastily raised his
      foot, and satan seized the moment of inflicting this chastisement
      on his vanity.]

      the monastic saints, who excite only the contempt and pity of a
      philosopher, were respected, and almost adored, by the prince and
      people. successive crowds of pilgrims from gaul and india saluted
      the divine pillar of simeon: the tribes of saracens disputed in
      arms the honor of his benediction; the queens of arabia and
      persia gratefully confessed his supernatural virtue; and the
      angelic hermit was consulted by the younger theodosius, in the
      most important concerns of the church and state. his remains were
      transported from the mountain of telenissa, by a solemn
      procession of the patriarch, the master-general of the east, six
      bishops, twenty-one counts or tribunes, and six thousand
      soldiers; and antioch revered his bones, as her glorious ornament
      and impregnable defence. the fame of the apostles and martyrs was
      gradually eclipsed by these recent and popular anachorets; the
      christian world fell prostrate before their shrines; and the
      miracles ascribed to their relics exceeded, at least in number
      and duration, the spiritual exploits of their lives. but the
      golden legend of their lives 73 was embellished by the artful
      credulity of their interested brethren; and a believing age was
      easily persuaded, that the slightest caprice of an egyptian or a
      syrian monk had been sufficient to interrupt the eternal laws of
      the universe. the favorites of heaven were accustomed to cure
      inveterate diseases with a touch, a word, or a distant message;
      and to expel the most obstinate demons from the souls or bodies
      which they possessed. they familiarly accosted, or imperiously
      commanded, the lions and serpents of the desert; infused
      vegetation into a sapless trunk; suspended iron on the surface of
      the water; passed the nile on the back of a crocodile, and
      refreshed themselves in a fiery furnace. these extravagant tales,
      which display the fiction without the genius, of poetry, have
      seriously affected the reason, the faith, and the morals, of the
      christians. their credulity debased and vitiated the faculties of
      the mind: they corrupted the evidence of history; and
      superstition gradually extinguished the hostile light of
      philosophy and science. every mode of religious worship which had
      been practised by the saints, every mysterious doctrine which
      they believed, was fortified by the sanction of divine
      revelation, and all the manly virtues were oppressed by the
      servile and pusillanimous reign of the monks. if it be possible
      to measure the interval between the philosophic writings of
      cicero and the sacred legend of theodoret, between the character
      of cato and that of simeon, we may appreciate the memorable
      revolution which was accomplished in the roman empire within a
      period of five hundred years.

      severus, and his life of st. martin. he reveres the monks of
      egypt; yet he insults them with the remark, that they never
      raised the dead; whereas the bishop of tours had restored three
      dead men to life.]

      ii. the progress of christianity has been marked by two glorious
      and decisive victories: over the learned and luxurious citizens
      of the roman empire; and over the warlike barbarians of scythia
      and germany, who subverted the empire, and embraced the religion,
      of the romans. the goths were the foremost of these savage
      proselytes; and the nation was indebted for its conversion to a
      countryman, or, at least, to a subject, worthy to be ranked among
      the inventors of useful arts, who have deserved the remembrance
      and gratitude of posterity. a great number of roman provincials
      had been led away into captivity by the gothic bands, who ravaged
      asia in the time of gallienus; and of these captives, many were
      christians, and several belonged to the ecclesiastical order.
      those involuntary missionaries, dispersed as slaves in the
      villages of dacia, successively labored for the salvation of
      their masters. the seeds which they planted, of the evangelic
      doctrine, were gradually propagated; and before the end of a
      century, the pious work was achieved by the labors of ulphilas,
      whose ancestors had been transported beyond the danube from a
      small town of cappadocia.

      ulphilas, the bishop and apostle of the goths, 74 acquired their
      love and reverence by his blameless life and indefatigable zeal;
      and they received, with implicit confidence, the doctrines of
      truth and virtue which he preached and practised. he executed the
      arduous task of translating the scriptures into their native
      tongue, a dialect of the german or teutonic language; but he
      prudently suppressed the four books of kings, as they might tend
      to irritate the fierce and sanguinary spirit of the barbarians.
      the rude, imperfect idiom of soldiers and shepherds, so ill
      qualified to communicate any spiritual ideas, was improved and
      modulated by his genius: and ulphilas, before he could frame his
      version, was obliged to compose a new alphabet of twenty-four
      letters; 741 four of which he invented, to express the peculiar
      sounds that were unknown to the greek and latin pronunciation. 75
      but the prosperous state of the gothic church was soon afflicted
      by war and intestine discord, and the chieftains were divided by
      religion as well as by interest. fritigern, the friend of the
      romans, became the proselyte of ulphilas; while the haughty soul
      of athanaric disdained the yoke of the empire and of the gospel.
      the faith of the new converts was tried by the persecution which
      he excited. a wagon, bearing aloft the shapeless image of thor,
      perhaps, or of woden, was conducted in solemn procession through
      the streets of the camp; and the rebels, who refused to worship
      the god of their fathers, were immediately burnt, with their
      tents and families. the character of ulphilas recommended him to
      the esteem of the eastern court, where he twice appeared as the
      minister of peace; he pleaded the cause of the distressed goths,
      who implored the protection of valens; and the name of moses was
      applied to this spiritual guide, who conducted his people through
      the deep waters of the danube to the land of promise. 76 the
      devout shepherds, who were attached to his person, and tractable
      to his voice, acquiesced in their settlement, at the foot of the
      maesian mountains, in a country of woodlands and pastures, which
      supported their flocks and herds, and enabled them to purchase
      the corn and wine of the more plentiful provinces. these harmless
      barbarians multiplied in obscure peace and the profession of
      christianity. 77

      chapter xxxvii: conversion of the barbarians to
      christianity.part iii.

      the different motives which influenced the reason, or the
      passions, of the barbarian converts, cannot easily be
      ascertained. they were often capricious and accidental; a dream,
      an omen, the report of a miracle, the example of some priest, or
      hero, the charms of a believing wife, and, above all, the
      fortunate event of a prayer, or vow, which, in a moment of
      danger, they had addressed to the god of the christians. 80 the
      early prejudices of education were insensibly erased by the
      habits of frequent and familiar society, the moral precepts of
      the gospel were protected by the extravagant virtues of the
      monks; and a spiritual theology was supported by the visible
      power of relics, and the pomp of religious worship. but the
      rational and ingenious mode of persuasion, which a saxon bishop
      81 suggested to a popular saint, might sometimes be employed by
      the missionaries, who labored for the conversion of infidels.
      admit, says the sagacious disputant, whatever they are pleased
      to assert of the fabulous, and carnal, genealogy of their gods
      and goddesses, who are propagated from each other. from this
      principle deduce their imperfect nature, and human infirmities,
      the assurance they were born, and the probability that they will
      die. at what time, by what means, from what cause, were the
      eldest of the gods or goddesses produced? do they still continue,
      or have they ceased, to propagate? if they have ceased, summon
      your antagonists to declare the reason of this strange
      alteration. if they still continue, the number of the gods must
      become infinite; and shall we not risk, by the indiscreet worship
      of some impotent deity, to excite the resentment of his jealous
      superior? the visible heavens and earth, the whole system of the
      universe, which may be conceived by the mind, is it created or
      eternal? if created, how, or where, could the gods themselves
      exist before creation? if eternal, how could they assume the
      empire of an independent and preexisting world? urge these
      arguments with temper and moderation; insinuate, at seasonable
      intervals, the truth and beauty of the christian revelation; and
      endeavor to make the unbelievers ashamed, without making them
      angry. this metaphysical reasoning, too refined, perhaps, for
      the barbarians of germany, was fortified by the grosser weight of
      authority and popular consent. the advantage of temporal
      prosperity had deserted the pagan cause, and passed over to the
      service of christianity. the romans themselves, the most powerful
      and enlightened nation of the globe, had renounced their ancient
      superstition; and, if the ruin of their empire seemed to accuse
      the efficacy of the new faith, the disgrace was already retrieved
      by the conversion of the victorious goths. the valiant and
      fortunate barbarians, who subdued the provinces of the west,
      successively received, and reflected, the same edifying example.
      before the age of charlemagne, the christian nations of europe
      might exult in the exclusive possession of the temperate
      climates, of the fertile lands, which produced corn, wine, and
      oil; while the savage idolaters, and their helpless idols, were
      confined to the extremities of the earth, the dark and frozen
      regions of the north. 82

      argument; but when daniel wrote this epistle, (a.d. 723,) the
      mahometans, who reigned from india to spain, might have retorted
      it against the christians.]

      christianity, which opened the gates of heaven to the barbarians,
      introduced an important change in their moral and political
      condition. they received, at the same time, the use of letters,
      so essential to a religion whose doctrines are contained in a
      sacred book; and while they studied the divine truth, their minds
      were insensibly enlarged by the distant view of history, of
      nature, of the arts, and of society. the version of the
      scriptures into their native tongue, which had facilitated their
      conversion, must excite among their clergy some curiosity to read
      the original text, to understand the sacred liturgy of the
      church, and to examine, in the writings of the fathers, the chain
      of ecclesiastical tradition. these spiritual gifts were preserved
      in the greek and latin languages, which concealed the inestimable
      monuments of ancient learning. the immortal productions of
      virgil, cicero, and livy, which were accessible to the christian
      barbarians, maintained a silent intercourse between the reign of
      augustus and the times of clovis and charlemagne. the emulation
      of mankind was encouraged by the remembrance of a more perfect
      state; and the flame of science was secretly kept alive, to warm
      and enlighten the mature age of the western world.

      in the most corrupt state of christianity, the barbarians might
      learn justice from the law, and mercy from the gospel; and if the
      knowledge of their duty was insufficient to guide their actions,
      or to regulate their passions, they were sometimes restrained by
      conscience, and frequently punished by remorse. but the direct
      authority of religion was less effectual than the holy communion,
      which united them with their christian brethren in spiritual
      friendship. the influence of these sentiments contributed to
      secure their fidelity in the service, or the alliance, of the
      romans, to alleviate the horrors of war, to moderate the
      insolence of conquest, and to preserve, in the downfall of the
      empire, a permanent respect for the name and institutions of
      rome. in the days of paganism, the priests of gaul and germany
      reigned over the people, and controlled the jurisdiction of the
      magistrates; and the zealous proselytes transferred an equal, or
      more ample, measure of devout obedience, to the pontiffs of the
      christian faith. the sacred character of the bishops was
      supported by their temporal possessions; they obtained an
      honorable seat in the legislative assemblies of soldiers and
      freemen; and it was their interest, as well as their duty, to
      mollify, by peaceful counsels, the fierce spirit of the
      barbarians. the perpetual correspondence of the latin clergy, the
      frequent pilgrimages to rome and jerusalem, and the growing
      authority of the popes, cemented the union of the christian
      republic, and gradually produced the similar manners, and common
      jurisprudence, which have distinguished, from the rest of
      mankind, the independent, and even hostile, nations of modern
      europe.

      but the operation of these causes was checked and retarded by the
      unfortunate accident, which infused a deadly poison into the cup
      of salvation. whatever might be the early sentiments of ulphilas,
      his connections with the empire and the church were formed during
      the reign of arianism. the apostle of the goths subscribed the
      creed of rimini; professed with freedom, and perhaps with
      sincerity, that the son was not equal, or consubstantial to the
      father; 83 communicated these errors to the clergy and people;
      and infected the barbaric world with a heresy, 84 which the great
      theodosius proscribed and extinguished among the romans. the
      temper and understanding of the new proselytes were not adapted
      to metaphysical subtilties; but they strenuously maintained, what
      they had piously received, as the pure and genuine doctrines of
      christianity. the advantage of preaching and expounding the
      scriptures in the teutonic language promoted the apostolic labors
      of ulphilas and his successors; and they ordained a competent
      number of bishops and presbyters for the instruction of the
      kindred tribes. the ostrogoths, the burgundians, the suevi, and
      the vandals, who had listened to the eloquence of the latin
      clergy, 85 preferred the more intelligible lessons of their
      domestic teachers; and arianism was adopted as the national faith
      of the warlike converts, who were seated on the ruins of the
      western empire. this irreconcilable difference of religion was a
      perpetual source of jealousy and hatred; and the reproach of
      barbarian was imbittered by the more odious epithet of heretic.
      the heroes of the north, who had submitted, with some reluctance,
      to believe that all their ancestors were in hell, 86 were
      astonished and exasperated to learn, that they themselves had
      only changed the mode of their eternal condemnation. instead of
      the smooth applause, which christian kings are accustomed to
      expect from their royal prelates, the orthodox bishops and their
      clergy were in a state of opposition to the arian courts; and
      their indiscreet opposition frequently became criminal, and might
      sometimes be dangerous. 87 the pulpit, that safe and sacred organ
      of sedition, resounded with the names of pharaoh and holofernes;
      88 the public discontent was inflamed by the hope or promise of a
      glorious deliverance; and the seditious saints were tempted to
      promote the accomplishment of their own predictions.
      notwithstanding these provocations, the catholics of gaul, spain,
      and italy, enjoyed, under the reign of the arians, the free and
      peaceful exercise of their religion. their haughty masters
      respected the zeal of a numerous people, resolved to die at the
      foot of their altars; and the example of their devout constancy
      was admired and imitated by the barbarians themselves. the
      conquerors evaded, however, the disgraceful reproach, or
      confession, of fear, by attributing their toleration to the
      liberal motives of reason and humanity; and while they affected
      the language, they imperceptiby imbibed the spirit, of genuine
      christianity.

      83 (return) [ the opinions of ulphilas and the goths inclined to
      semi-arianism, since they would not say that the son was a
      creature, though they held communion with those who maintained
      that heresy. their apostle represented the whole controversy as a
      question of trifling moment, which had been raised by the
      passions of the clergy. theodoret l. iv. c. 37.]

      the peace of the church was sometimes interrupted. the catholics
      were indiscreet, the barbarians were impatient; and the partial
      acts of severity or injustice, which had been recommended by the
      arian clergy, were exaggerated by the orthodox writers. the guilt
      of persecution may be imputed to euric, king of the visigoths;
      who suspended the exercise of ecclesiastical, or, at least, of
      episcopal functions; and punished the popular bishops of aquitain
      with imprisonment, exile, and confiscation. 89 but the cruel and
      absurd enterprise of subduing the minds of a whole people was
      undertaken by the vandals alone. genseric himself, in his early
      youth, had renounced the orthodox communion; and the apostate
      could neither grant, nor expect, a sincere forgiveness. he was
      exasperated to find that the africans, who had fled before him in
      the field, still presumed to dispute his will in synods and
      churches; and his ferocious mind was incapable of fear or of
      compassion. his catholic subjects were oppressed by intolerant
      laws and arbitrary punishments. the language of genseric was
      furious and formidable; the knowledge of his intentions might
      justify the most unfavorable interpretation of his actions; and
      the arians were reproached with the frequent executions which
      stained the palace and the dominions of the tyrant. arms and
      ambition were, however, the ruling passions of the monarch of the
      sea. but hunneric, his inglorious son, who seemed to inherit only
      his vices, tormented the catholics with the same unrelenting fury
      which had been fatal to his brother, his nephews, and the friends
      and favorites of his father; and even to the arian patriarch, who
      was inhumanly burnt alive in the midst of carthage. the religious
      war was preceded and prepared by an insidious truce; persecution
      was made the serious and important business of the vandal court;
      and the loathsome disease which hastened the death of hunneric,
      revenged the injuries, without contributing to the deliverance,
      of the church. the throne of africa was successively filled by
      the two nephews of hunneric; by gundamund, who reigned about
      twelve, and by thrasimund, who governed the nation about
      twenty-seven, years. their administration was hostile and
      oppressive to the orthodox party. gundamund appeared to emulate,
      or even to surpass, the cruelty of his uncle; and, if at length
      he relented, if he recalled the bishops, and restored the freedom
      of athanasian worship, a premature death intercepted the benefits
      of his tardy clemency. his brother, thrasimund, was the greatest
      and most accomplished of the vandal kings, whom he excelled in
      beauty, prudence, and magnanimity of soul. but this magnanimous
      character was degraded by his intolerant zeal and deceitful
      clemency. instead of threats and tortures, he employed the
      gentle, but efficacious, powers of seduction. wealth, dignity,
      and the royal favor, were the liberal rewards of apostasy; the
      catholics, who had violated the laws, might purchase their pardon
      by the renunciation of their faith; and whenever thrasimund
      meditated any rigorous measure, he patiently waited till the
      indiscretion of his adversaries furnished him with a specious
      opportunity. bigotry was his last sentiment in the hour of death;
      and he exacted from his successor a solemn oath, that he would
      never tolerate the sectaries of athanasius. but his successor,
      hilderic, the gentle son of the savage hunneric, preferred the
      duties of humanity and justice to the vain obligation of an
      impious oath; and his accession was gloriously marked by the
      restoration of peace and universal freedom. the throne of that
      virtuous, though feeble monarch, was usurped by his cousin
      gelimer, a zealous arian: but the vandal kingdom, before he could
      enjoy or abuse his power, was subverted by the arms of
      belisarius; and the orthodox party retaliated the injuries which
      they had endured. 90

      hunneric; in the life of st. fulgentius, who was distinguished in
      the persecution of thrasimund (in biblioth. max. patrum, tom. ix.
      p. 4-16;) and in the first book of the vandalic war, by the
      impartial procopius, (c. 7, 8, p. 196, 197, 198, 199.) dom
      ruinart, the last editor of victor, has illustrated the whole
      subject with a copious and learned apparatus of notes and
      supplement (paris, 1694.)]

      the passionate declamations of the catholics, the sole historians
      of this persecution, cannot afford any distinct series of causes
      and events; any impartial view of the characters, or counsels;
      but the most remarkable circumstances that deserve either credit
      or notice, may be referred to the following heads; i. in the
      original law, which is still extant, 91 hunneric expressly
      declares, (and the declaration appears to be correct,) that he
      had faithfully transcribed the regulations and penalties of the
      imperial edicts, against the heretical congregations, the clergy,
      and the people, who dissented from the established religion. if
      the rights of conscience had been understood, the catholics must
      have condemned their past conduct or acquiesced in their actual
      suffering. but they still persisted to refuse the indulgence
      which they claimed. while they trembled under the lash of
      persecution, they praised the laudable severity of hunneric
      himself, who burnt or banished great numbers of manichans; 92
      and they rejected, with horror, the ignominious compromise, that
      the disciples of arius and of athanasius should enjoy a
      reciprocal and similar toleration in the territories of the
      romans, and in those of the vandals. 93 ii. the practice of a
      conference, which the catholics had so frequently used to insult
      and punish their obstinate antagonists, was retorted against
      themselves. 94 at the command of hunneric, four hundred and
      sixty-six orthodox bishops assembled at carthage; but when they
      were admitted into the hall of audience, they had the
      mortification of beholding the arian cyrila exalted on the
      patriarchal throne. the disputants were separated, after the
      mutual and ordinary reproaches of noise and silence, of delay and
      precipitation, of military force and of popular clamor. one
      martyr and one confessor were selected among the catholic
      bishops; twenty-eight escaped by flight, and eighty-eight by
      conformity; forty-six were sent into corsica to cut timber for
      the royal navy; and three hundred and two were banished to the
      different parts of africa, exposed to the insults of their
      enemies, and carefully deprived of all the temporal and spiritual
      comforts of life. 95 the hardships of ten years exile must have
      reduced their numbers; and if they had complied with the law of
      thrasimund, which prohibited any episcopal consecrations, the
      orthodox church of africa must have expired with the lives of its
      actual members. they disobeyed, and their disobedience was
      punished by a second exile of two hundred and twenty bishops into
      sardinia; where they languished fifteen years, till the accession
      of the gracious hilderic. 96 the two islands were judiciously
      chosen by the malice of their arian tyrants. seneca, from his own
      experience, has deplored and exaggerated the miserable state of
      corsica, 97 and the plenty of sardinia was overbalanced by the
      unwholesome quality of the air. 98 iii. the zeal of genseric and
      his successors, for the conversion of the catholics, must have
      rendered them still more jealous to guard the purity of the
      vandal faith. before the churches were finally shut, it was a
      crime to appear in a barbarian dress; and those who presumed to
      neglect the royal mandate were rudely dragged backwards by their
      long hair. 99 the palatine officers, who refused to profess the
      religion of their prince, were ignominiously stripped of their
      honors and employments; banished to sardinia and sicily; or
      condemned to the servile labors of slaves and peasants in the
      fields of utica. in the districts which had been peculiarly
      allotted to the vandals, the exercise of the catholic worship was
      more strictly prohibited; and severe penalties were denounced
      against the guilt both of the missionary and the proselyte. by
      these arts, the faith of the barbarians was preserved, and their
      zeal was inflamed: they discharged, with devout fury, the office
      of spies, informers, or executioners; and whenever their cavalry
      took the field, it was the favorite amusement of the march to
      defile the churches, and to insult the clergy of the adverse
      faction. 100 iv. the citizens who had been educated in the luxury
      of the roman province, were delivered, with exquisite cruelty, to
      the moors of the desert. a venerable train of bishops,
      presbyters, and deacons, with a faithful crowd of four thousand
      and ninety-six persons, whose guilt is not precisely ascertained,
      were torn from their native homes, by the command of hunneric.
      during the night they were confined, like a herd of cattle,
      amidst their own ordure: during the day they pursued their march
      over the burning sands; and if they fainted under the heat and
      fatigue, they were goaded, or dragged along, till they expired in
      the hands of their tormentors. 101 these unhappy exiles, when
      they reached the moorish huts, might excite the compassion of a
      people, whose native humanity was neither improved by reason, nor
      corrupted by fanaticism: but if they escaped the dangers, they
      were condemned to share the distress of a savage life. v. it is
      incumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect,
      whether they are determined to support it in the last extreme.
      they excite the flame which they strive to extinguish; and it
      soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy, as well as the
      crime, of the offender. the fine, which he is unable or unwilling
      to discharge, exposes his person to the severity of the law; and
      his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety
      of capital punishment. through the veil of fiction and
      declamation we may clearly perceive, that the catholics more
      especially under the reign of hunneric, endured the most cruel
      and ignominious treatment. 102 respectable citizens, noble
      matrons, and consecrated virgins, were stripped naked, and raised
      in the air by pulleys, with a weight suspended at their feet. in
      this painful attitude their naked bodies were torn with scourges,
      or burnt in the most tender parts with red-hot plates of iron.
      the amputation of the ears the nose, the tongue, and the right
      hand, was inflicted by the arians; and although the precise
      number cannot be defined, it is evident that many persons, among
      whom a bishop 103 and a proconsul 104 may be named, were entitled
      to the crown of martyrdom. the same honor has been ascribed to
      the memory of count sebastian, who professed the nicene creed
      with unshaken constancy; and genseric might detest, as a heretic,
      the brave and ambitious fugitive whom he dreaded as a rival. 105
      vi. a new mode of conversion, which might subdue the feeble, and
      alarm the timorous, was employed by the arian ministers. they
      imposed, by fraud or violence, the rites of baptism; and punished
      the apostasy of the catholics, if they disclaimed this odious and
      profane ceremony, which scandalously violated the freedom of the
      will, and the unity of the sacrament. 106 the hostile sects had
      formerly allowed the validity of each others baptism; and the
      innovation, so fiercely maintained by the vandals, can be imputed
      only to the example and advice of the donatists. vii. the arian
      clergy surpassed in religious cruelty the king and his vandals;
      but they were incapable of cultivating the spiritual vineyard,
      which they were so desirous to possess. a patriarch 107 might
      seat himself on the throne of carthage; some bishops, in the
      principal cities, might usurp the place of their rivals; but the
      smallness of their numbers, and their ignorance of the latin
      language, 108 disqualified the barbarians for the ecclesiastical
      ministry of a great church; and the africans, after the loss of
      their orthodox pastors, were deprived of the public exercise of
      christianity. viii. the emperors were the natural protectors of
      the homoousian doctrine; and the faithful people of africa, both
      as romans and as catholics, preferred their lawful sovereignty to
      the usurpation of the barbarous heretics. during an interval of
      peace and friendship, hunneric restored the cathedral of
      carthage; at the intercession of zeno, who reigned in the east,
      and of placidia, the daughter and relict of emperors, and the
      sister of the queen of the vandals. 109 but this decent regard
      was of short duration; and the haughty tyrant displayed his
      contempt for the religion of the empire, by studiously arranging
      the bloody images of persecution, in all the principal streets
      through which the roman ambassador must pass in his way to the
      palace. 110 an oath was required from the bishops, who were
      assembled at carthage, that they would support the succession of
      his son hilderic, and that they would renounce all foreign or
      transmarine correspondence. this engagement, consistent, as it
      should seem, with their moral and religious duties, was refused
      by the more sagacious members 111 of the assembly. their refusal,
      faintly colored by the pretence that it is unlawful for a
      christian to swear, must provoke the suspicions of a jealous
      tyrant.

      chapter xxxvii: conversion of the barbarians to
      christianity.part iv.

      the catholics, oppressed by royal and military force, were far
      superior to their adversaries in numbers and learning. with the
      same weapons which the greek 112 and latin fathers had already
      provided for the arian controversy, they repeatedly silenced, or
      vanquished, the fierce and illiterate successors of ulphilas. the
      consciousness of their own superiority might have raised them
      above the arts and passions of religious warfare. yet, instead of
      assuming such honorable pride, the orthodox theologians were
      tempted, by the assurance of impunity, to compose fictions, which
      must be stigmatized with the epithets of fraud and forgery. they
      ascribed their own polemical works to the most venerable names of
      christian antiquity; the characters of athanasius and augustin
      were awkwardly personated by vigilius and his disciples; 113 and
      the famous creed, which so clearly expounds the mysteries of the
      trinity and the incarnation, is deduced, with strong probability,
      from this african school. 114 even the scriptures themselves were
      profaned by their rash and sacrilegious hands. the memorable
      text, which asserts the unity of the three who bear witness in
      heaven, 115 is condemned by the universal silence of the orthodox
      fathers, ancient versions, and authentic manuscripts. 116 it was
      first alleged by the catholic bishops whom hunneric summoned to
      the conference of carthage. 117 an allegorical interpretation, in
      the form, perhaps, of a marginal note, invaded the text of the
      latin bibles, which were renewed and corrected in a dark period
      of ten centuries. 118 after the invention of printing, 119 the
      editors of the greek testament yielded to their own prejudices,
      or those of the times; 120 and the pious fraud, which was
      embraced with equal zeal at rome and at geneva, has been
      infinitely multiplied in every country and every language of
      modern europe.

      falsehood, or strange misapprehension, of theodore beza.]

      the example of fraud must excite suspicion: and the specious
      miracles by which the african catholics have defended the truth
      and justice of their cause, may be ascribed, with more reason, to
      their own industry, than to the visible protection of heaven. yet
      the historian, who views this religious conflict with an
      impartial eye, may condescend to mention one preternatural event,
      which will edify the devout, and surprise the incredulous.
      tipasa, 121 a maritime colony of mauritania, sixteen miles to the
      east of caesarea, had been distinguished, in every age, by the
      orthodox zeal of its inhabitants. they had braved the fury of the
      donatists; 122 they resisted, or eluded, the tyranny of the
      arians. the town was deserted on the approach of an heretical
      bishop: most of the inhabitants who could procure ships passed
      over to the coast of spain; and the unhappy remnant, refusing all
      communion with the usurper, still presumed to hold their pious,
      but illegal, assemblies. their disobedience exasperated the
      cruelty of hunneric. a military count was despatched from
      carthage to tipasa: he collected the catholics in the forum, and,
      in the presence of the whole province, deprived the guilty of
      their right hands and their tongues. but the holy confessors
      continued to speak without tongues; and this miracle is attested
      by victor, an african bishop, who published a history of the
      persecution within two years after the event. 123 if any one,
      says victor, should doubt of the truth, let him repair to
      constantinople, and listen to the clear and perfect language of
      restitutus, the sub-deacon, one of these glorious sufferers, who
      is now lodged in the palace of the emperor zeno, and is respected
      by the devout empress. at constantinople we are astonished to
      find a cool, a learned, and unexceptionable witness, without
      interest, and without passion. aeneas of gaza, a platonic
      philosopher, has accurately described his own observations on
      these african sufferers. i saw them myself: i heard them speak:
      i diligently inquired by what means such an articulate voice
      could be formed without any organ of speech: i used my eyes to
      examine the report of my ears; i opened their mouth, and saw that
      the whole tongue had been completely torn away by the roots; an
      operation which the physicians generally suppose to be mortal.
      124 the testimony of aeneas of gaza might be confirmed by the
      superfluous evidence of the emperor justinian, in a perpetual
      edict; of count marcellinus, in his chronicle of the times; and
      of pope gregory the first, who had resided at constantinople, as
      the minister of the roman pontiff. 125 they all lived within the
      compass of a century; and they all appeal to their personal
      knowledge, or the public notoriety, for the truth of a miracle,
      which was repeated in several instances, displayed on the
      greatest theatre of the world, and submitted, during a series of
      years, to the calm examination of the senses. this supernatural
      gift of the african confessors, who spoke without tongues, will
      command the assent of those, and of those only, who already
      believe, that their language was pure and orthodox. but the
      stubborn mind of an infidel, is guarded by secret, incurable
      suspicion; and the arian, or socinian, who has seriously rejected
      the doctrine of a trinity, will not be shaken by the most
      plausible evidence of an athanasian miracle.

      the vandals and the ostrogoths persevered in the profession of
      arianism till the final ruin of the kingdoms which they had
      founded in africa and italy. the barbarians of gaul submitted to
      the orthodox dominion of the franks; and spain was restored to
      the catholic church by the voluntary conversion of the visigoths.

      this salutary revolution 126 was hastened by the example of a
      royal martyr, whom our calmer reason may style an ungrateful
      rebel. leovigild, the gothic monarch of spain, deserved the
      respect of his enemies, and the love of his subjects; the
      catholics enjoyed a free toleration, and his arian synods
      attempted, without much success, to reconcile their scruples by
      abolishing the unpopular rite of a second baptism. his eldest son
      hermenegild, who was invested by his father with the royal
      diadem, and the fair principality of boetica, contracted an
      honorable and orthodox alliance with a merovingian princess, the
      daughter of sigebert, king of austrasia, and of the famous
      brunechild. the beauteous ingundis, who was no more than thirteen
      years of age, was received, beloved, and persecuted, in the arian
      court of toledo; and her religious constancy was alternately
      assaulted with blandishments and violence by goisvintha, the
      gothic queen, who abused the double claim of maternal authority.
      127 incensed by her resistance, goisvintha seized the catholic
      princess by her long hair, inhumanly dashed her against the
      ground, kicked her till she was covered with blood, and at last
      gave orders that she should be stripped, and thrown into a basin,
      or fish-pond. 128 love and honor might excite hermenegild to
      resent this injurious treatment of his bride; and he was
      gradually persuaded that ingundis suffered for the cause of
      divine truth. her tender complaints, and the weighty arguments of
      leander, archbishop of seville, accomplished his conversion and
      the heir of the gothic monarchy was initiated in the nicene faith
      by the solemn rites of confirmation. 129 the rash youth, inflamed
      by zeal, and perhaps by ambition, was tempted to violate the
      duties of a son and a subject; and the catholics of spain,
      although they could not complain of persecution, applauded his
      pious rebellion against an heretical father. the civil war was
      protracted by the long and obstinate sieges of merida, cordova,
      and seville, which had strenuously espoused the party of
      hermenegild. he invited the orthodox barbarians, the seuvi, and
      the franks, to the destruction of his native land; he solicited
      the dangerous aid of the romans, who possessed africa, and a part
      of the spanish coast; and his holy ambassador, the archbishop
      leander, effectually negotiated in person with the byzantine
      court. but the hopes of the catholics were crushed by the active
      diligence of the monarch who commanded the troops and treasures
      of spain; and the guilty hermenegild, after his vain attempts to
      resist or to escape, was compelled to surrender himself into the
      hands of an incensed father. leovigild was still mindful of that
      sacred character; and the rebel, despoiled of the regal
      ornaments, was still permitted, in a decent exile, to profess the
      catholic religion. his repeated and unsuccessful treasons at
      length provoked the indignation of the gothic king; and the
      sentence of death, which he pronounced with apparent reluctance,
      was privately executed in the tower of seville. the inflexible
      constancy with which he refused to accept the arian communion, as
      the price of his safety, may excuse the honors that have been
      paid to the memory of st. hermenegild. his wife and infant son
      were detained by the romans in ignominious captivity; and this
      domestic misfortune tarnished the glories of leovigild, and
      imbittered the last moments of his life.

      his son and successor, recared, the first catholic king of spain,
      had imbibed the faith of his unfortunate brother, which he
      supported with more prudence and success. instead of revolting
      against his father, recared patiently expected the hour of his
      death. instead of condemning his memory, he piously supposed,
      that the dying monarch had abjured the errors of arianism, and
      recommended to his son the conversion of the gothic nation. to
      accomplish that salutary end, recared convened an assembly of the
      arian clergy and nobles, declared himself a catholic, and
      exhorted them to imitate the example of their prince. the
      laborious interpretation of doubtful texts, or the curious
      pursuit of metaphysical arguments, would have excited an endless
      controversy; and the monarch discreetly proposed to his
      illiterate audience two substantial and visible arguments,the
      testimony of earth, and of heaven. the earth had submitted to the
      nicene synod: the romans, the barbarians, and the inhabitants of
      spain, unanimously professed the same orthodox creed; and the
      visigoths resisted, almost alone, the consent of the christian
      world. a superstitious age was prepared to reverence, as the
      testimony of heaven, the preternatural cures, which were
      performed by the skill or virtue of the catholic clergy; the
      baptismal fonts of osset in boetica, 130 which were spontaneously
      replenished every year, on the vigil of easter; 131 and the
      miraculous shrine of st. martin of tours, which had already
      converted the suevic prince and people of gallicia. 132 the
      catholic king encountered some difficulties on this important
      change of the national religion. a conspiracy, secretly fomented
      by the queen-dowager, was formed against his life; and two counts
      excited a dangerous revolt in the narbonnese gaul. but recared
      disarmed the conspirators, defeated the rebels, and executed
      severe justice; which the arians, in their turn, might brand with
      the reproach of persecution. eight bishops, whose names betray
      their barbaric origin, abjured their errors; and all the books of
      arian theology were reduced to ashes, with the house in which
      they had been purposely collected. the whole body of the
      visigoths and suevi were allured or driven into the pale of the
      catholic communion; the faith, at least of the rising generation,
      was fervent and sincere: and the devout liberality of the
      barbarians enriched the churches and monasteries of spain.
      seventy bishops, assembled in the council of toledo, received the
      submission of their conquerors; and the zeal of the spaniards
      improved the nicene creed, by declaring the procession of the
      holy ghost from the son, as well as from the father; a weighty
      point of doctrine, which produced, long afterwards, the schism of
      the greek and latin churches. 133 the royal proselyte immediately
      saluted and consulted pope gregory, surnamed the great, a learned
      and holy prelate, whose reign was distinguished by the conversion
      of heretics and infidels. the ambassadors of recared respectfully
      offered on the threshold of the vatican his rich presents of gold
      and gems; they accepted, as a lucrative exchange, the hairs of
      st. john the baptist; a cross, which enclosed a small piece of
      the true wood; and a key, that contained some particles of iron
      which had been scraped from the chains of st. peter. 134

      century.]

      the first missionaries who preached the gospel to the barbarians,
      appealed to the evidence of reason, and claimed the benefit of
      toleration. 136 but no sooner had they established their
      spiritual dominion, than they exhorted the christian kings to
      extirpate, without mercy, the remains of roman or barbaric
      superstition. the successors of clovis inflicted one hundred
      lashes on the peasants who refused to destroy their idols; the
      crime of sacrificing to the demons was punished by the
      anglo-saxon laws with the heavier penalties of imprisonment and
      confiscation; and even the wise alfred adopted, as an
      indispensable duty, the extreme rigor of the mosaic institutions.
      137 but the punishment and the crime were gradually abolished
      among a christian people; the theological disputes of the schools
      were suspended by propitious ignorance; and the intolerant spirit
      which could find neither idolaters nor heretics, was reduced to
      the persecution of the jews. that exiled nation had founded some
      synagogues in the cities of gaul; but spain, since the time of
      hadrian, was filled with their numerous colonies. 138 the wealth
      which they accumulated by trade, and the management of the
      finances, invited the pious avarice of their masters; and they
      might be oppressed without danger, as they had lost the use, and
      even the remembrance, of arms. sisebut, a gothic king, who
      reigned in the beginning of the seventh century, proceeded at
      once to the last extremes of persecution. 139 ninety thousand
      jews were compelled to receive the sacrament of baptism; the
      fortunes of the obstinate infidels were confiscated, their bodies
      were tortured; and it seems doubtful whether they were permitted
      to abandon their native country. the excessive zeal of the
      catholic king was moderated, even by the clergy of spain, who
      solemnly pronounced an inconsistent sentence: that the sacraments
      should not be forcibly imposed; but that the jews who had been
      baptized should be constrained, for the honor of the church, to
      persevere in the external practice of a religion which they
      disbelieved and detested. their frequent relapses provoked one of
      the successors of sisebut to banish the whole nation from his
      dominions; and a council of toledo published a decree, that every
      gothic king should swear to maintain this salutary edict. but the
      tyrants were unwilling to dismiss the victims, whom they
      delighted to torture, or to deprive themselves of the industrious
      slaves, over whom they might exercise a lucrative oppression. the
      jews still continued in spain, under the weight of the civil and
      ecclesiastical laws, which in the same country have been
      faithfully transcribed in the code of the inquisition. the gothic
      kings and bishops at length discovered, that injuries will
      produce hatred, and that hatred will find the opportunity of
      revenge. a nation, the secret or professed enemies of
      christianity, still multiplied in servitude and distress; and the
      intrigues of the jews promoted the rapid success of the arabian
      conquerors. 140

      as soon as the barbarians withdrew their powerful support, the
      unpopular heresy of arius sunk into contempt and oblivion. but
      the greeks still retained their subtle and loquacious
      disposition: the establishment of an obscure doctrine suggested
      new questions, and new disputes; and it was always in the power
      of an ambitious prelate, or a fanatic monk, to violate the peace
      of the church, and, perhaps, of the empire. the historian of the
      empire may overlook those disputes which were confined to the
      obscurity of schools and synods. the manichans, who labored to
      reconcile the religions of christ and of zoroaster, had secretly
      introduced themselves into the provinces: but these foreign
      sectaries were involved in the common disgrace of the gnostics,
      and the imperial laws were executed by the public hatred. the
      rational opinions of the pelagians were propagated from britain
      to rome, africa, and palestine, and silently expired in a
      superstitious age. but the east was distracted by the nestorian
      and eutychian controversies; which attempted to explain the
      mystery of the incarnation, and hastened the ruin of christianity
      in her native land. these controversies were first agitated under
      the reign of the younger theodosius: but their important
      consequences extend far beyond the limits of the present volume.
      the metaphysical chain of argument, the contests of
      ecclesiastical ambition, and their political influence on the
      decline of the byzantine empire, may afford an interesting and
      instructive series of history, from the general councils of
      ephesus and chalcedon, to the conquest of the east by the
      successors of mahomet.

      the gauls, 1 who impatiently supported the roman yoke, received a
      memorable lesson from one of the lieutenants of vespasian, whose
      weighty sense has been refined and expressed by the genius of
      tacitus. 2 the protection of the republic has delivered gaul
      from internal discord and foreign invasions. by the loss of
      national independence, you have acquired the name and privileges
      of roman citizens. you enjoy, in common with yourselves, the
      permanent benefits of civil government; and your remote situation
      is less exposed to the accidental mischiefs of tyranny. instead
      of exercising the rights of conquest, we have been contented to
      impose such tributes as are requisite for your own preservation.
      peace cannot be secured without armies; and armies must be
      supported at the expense of the people. it is for your sake, not
      for our own, that we guard the barrier of the rhine against the
      ferocious germans, who have so often attempted, and who will
      always desire, to exchange the solitude of their woods and
      morasses for the wealth and fertility of gaul. the fall of rome
      would be fatal to the provinces; and you would be buried in the
      ruins of that mighty fabric, which has been raised by the valor
      and wisdom of eight hundred years. your imaginary freedom would
      be insulted and oppressed by a savage master; and the expulsion
      of the romans would be succeeded by the eternal hostilities of
      the barbarian conquerors. 3 this salutary advice was accepted,
      and this strange prediction was accomplished. in the space of
      four hundred years, the hardy gauls, who had encountered the arms
      of caesar, were imperceptibly melted into the general mass of
      citizens and subjects: the western empire was dissolved; and the
      germans, who had passed the rhine, fiercely contended for the
      possession of gaul, and excited the contempt, or abhorrence, of
      its peaceful and polished inhabitants. with that conscious pride
      which the preeminence of knowledge and luxury seldom fails to
      inspire, they derided the hairy and gigantic savages of the
      north; their rustic manners, dissonant joy, voracious appetite,
      and their horrid appearance, equally disgusting to the sight and
      to the smell. the liberal studies were still cultivated in the
      schools of autun and bordeaux; and the language of cicero and
      virgil was familiar to the gallic youth. their ears were
      astonished by the harsh and unknown sounds of the germanic
      dialect, and they ingeniously lamented that the trembling muses
      fled from the harmony of a burgundian lyre. the gauls were
      endowed with all the advantages of art and nature; but as they
      wanted courage to defend them, they were justly condemned to
      obey, and even to flatter, the victorious barbarians, by whose
      clemency they held their precarious fortunes and their lives. 4

      as soon as odoacer had extinguished the western empire, he sought
      the friendship of the most powerful of the barbarians. the new
      sovereign of italy resigned to euric, king of the visigoths, all
      the roman conquests beyond the alps, as far as the rhine and the
      ocean: 5 and the senate might confirm this liberal gift with some
      ostentation of power, and without any real loss of revenue and
      dominion. the lawful pretensions of euric were justified by
      ambition and success; and the gothic nation might aspire, under
      his command, to the monarchy of spain and gaul. arles and
      marseilles surrendered to his arms: he oppressed the freedom of
      auvergne; and the bishop condescended to purchase his recall from
      exile by a tribute of just, but reluctant praise. sidonius waited
      before the gates of the palace among a crowd of ambassadors and
      suppliants; and their various business at the court of bordeaux
      attested the power, and the renown, of the king of the visigoths.
      the heruli of the distant ocean, who painted their naked bodies
      with its coerulean color, implored his protection; and the saxons
      respected the maritime provinces of a prince, who was destitute
      of any naval force. the tall burgundians submitted to his
      authority; nor did he restore the captive franks, till he had
      imposed on that fierce nation the terms of an unequal peace. the
      vandals of africa cultivated his useful friendship; and the
      ostrogoths of pannonia were supported by his powerful aid against
      the oppression of the neighboring huns. the north (such are the
      lofty strains of the poet) was agitated or appeased by the nod of
      euric; the great king of persia consulted the oracle of the west;
      and the aged god of the tyber was protected by the swelling
      genius of the garonne. 6 the fortune of nations has often
      depended on accidents; and france may ascribe her greatness to
      the premature death of the gothic king, at a time when his son
      alaric was a helpless infant, and his adversary clovis 7 an
      ambitious and valiant youth.

      while childeric, the father of clovis, lived an exile in germany,
      he was hospitably entertained by the queen, as well as by the
      king, of the thuringians. after his restoration, basina escaped
      from her husbands bed to the arms of her lover; freely
      declaring, that if she had known a man wiser, stronger, or more
      beautiful, than childeric, that man should have been the object
      of her preference. 8 9 clovis was the offspring of this voluntary
      union; and, when he was no more than fifteen years of age, he
      succeeded, by his fathers death, to the command of the salian
      tribe. the narrow limits of his kingdom were confined to the
      island of the batavians, with the ancient dioceses of tournay and
      arras; 10 and at the baptism of clovis the number of his warriors
      could not exceed five thousand. the kindred tribes of the franks,
      who had seated themselves along the belgic rivers, the scheld,
      the meuse, the moselle, and the rhine, were governed by their
      independent kings, of the merovingian race; the equals, the
      allies, and sometimes the enemies of the salic prince. but the
      germans, who obeyed, in peace, the hereditary jurisdiction of
      their chiefs, were free to follow the standard of a popular and
      victorious general; and the superior merit of clovis attracted
      the respect and allegiance of the national confederacy. when he
      first took the field, he had neither gold and silver in his
      coffers, nor wine and corn in his magazine; 11 but he imitated
      the example of caesar, who, in the same country, had acquired
      wealth by the sword, and purchased soldiers with the fruits of
      conquest. after each successful battle or expedition, the spoils
      were accumulated in one common mass; every warrior received his
      proportionable share; and the royal prerogative submitted to the
      equal regulations of military law. the untamed spirit of the
      barbarians was taught to acknowledge the advantages of regular
      discipline. 12 at the annual review of the month of march, their
      arms were diligently inspected; and when they traversed a
      peaceful territory, they were prohibited from touching a blade of
      grass. the justice of clovis was inexorable; and his careless or
      disobedient soldiers were punished with instant death. it would
      be superfluous to praise the valor of a frank; but the valor of
      clovis was directed by cool and consummate prudence. 13 in all
      his transactions with mankind, he calculated the weight of
      interest, of passion, and of opinion; and his measures were
      sometimes adapted to the sanguinary manners of the germans, and
      sometimes moderated by the milder genius of rome, and
      christianity. he was intercepted in the career of victory, since
      he died in the forty-fifth year of his age: but he had already
      accomplished, in a reign of thirty years, the establishment of
      the french monarchy in gaul.

      147-184) the political system of clovis.]

      the first exploit of clovis was the defeat of syagrius, the son
      of aegidius; and the public quarrel might, on this occasion, be
      inflamed by private resentment. the glory of the father still
      insulted the merovingian race; the power of the son might excite
      the jealous ambition of the king of the franks. syagrius
      inherited, as a patrimonial estate, the city and diocese of
      soissons: the desolate remnant of the second belgic, rheims and
      troyes, beauvais and amiens, would naturally submit to the count
      or patrician: 14 and after the dissolution of the western empire,
      he might reign with the title, or at least with the authority, of
      king of the romans. 15 as a roman, he had been educated in the
      liberal studies of rhetoric and jurisprudence; but he was engaged
      by accident and policy in the familiar use of the germanic idiom.
      the independent barbarians resorted to the tribunal of a
      stranger, who possessed the singular talent of explaining, in
      their native tongue, the dictates of reason and equity. the
      diligence and affability of their judge rendered him popular, the
      impartial wisdom of his decrees obtained their voluntary
      obedience, and the reign of syagrius over the franks and
      burgundians seemed to revive the original institution of civil
      society. 16 in the midst of these peaceful occupations, syagrius
      received, and boldly accepted, the hostile defiance of clovis;
      who challenged his rival in the spirit, and almost in the
      language, of chivalry, to appoint the day and the field 17 of
      battle. in the time of caesar soissons would have poured forth a
      body of fifty thousand horse and such an army might have been
      plentifully supplied with shields, cuirasses, and military
      engines, from the three arsenals or manufactures of the city. 18
      but the courage and numbers of the gallic youth were long since
      exhausted; and the loose bands of volunteers, or mercenaries, who
      marched under the standard of syagrius, were incapable of
      contending with the national valor of the franks. it would be
      ungenerous without some more accurate knowledge of his strength
      and resources, to condemn the rapid flight of syagrius, who
      escaped, after the loss of a battle, to the distant court of
      thoulouse. the feeble minority of alaric could not assist or
      protect an unfortunate fugitive; the pusillanimous 19 goths were
      intimidated by the menaces of clovis; and the roman king, after a
      short confinement, was delivered into the hands of the
      executioner. the belgic cities surrendered to the king of the
      franks; and his dominions were enlarged towards the east by the
      ample diocese of tongres 20 which clovis subdued in the tenth
      year of his reign.

      more anciently the country of the eburones, and more recently the
      diocese of liege.]

      the name of the alemanni has been absurdly derived from their
      imaginary settlement on the banks of the leman lake. 21 that
      fortunate district, from the lake to the avenche, and mount jura,
      was occupied by the burgundians. 22 the northern parts of
      helvetia had indeed been subdued by the ferocious alemanni, who
      destroyed with their own hands the fruits of their conquest. a
      province, improved and adorned by the arts of rome, was again
      reduced to a savage wilderness; and some vestige of the stately
      vindonissa may still be discovered in the fertile and populous
      valley of the aar. 23 from the source of the rhine to its conflux
      with the mein and the moselle, the formidable swarms of the
      alemanni commanded either side of the river, by the right of
      ancient possession, or recent victory. they had spread themselves
      into gaul, over the modern provinces of alsace and lorraine; and
      their bold invasion of the kingdom of cologne summoned the salic
      prince to the defence of his ripuarian allies.

      clovis encountered the invaders of gaul in the plain of tolbiac,
      about twenty-four miles from cologne; and the two fiercest
      nations of germany were mutually animated by the memory of past
      exploits, and the prospect of future greatness. the franks, after
      an obstinate struggle, gave way; and the alemanni, raising a
      shout of victory, impetuously pressed their retreat. but the
      battle was restored by the valor, and the conduct, and perhaps by
      the piety, of clovis; and the event of the bloody day decided
      forever the alternative of empire or servitude. the last king of
      the alemanni was slain in the field, and his people were
      slaughtered or pursued, till they threw down their arms, and
      yielded to the mercy of the conqueror. without discipline it was
      impossible for them to rally: they had contemptuously demolished
      the walls and fortifications which might have protected their
      distress; and they were followed into the heart of their forests
      by an enemy not less active, or intrepid, than themselves. the
      great theodoric congratulated the victory of clovis, whose sister
      albofleda the king of italy had lately married; but he mildly
      interceded with his brother in favor of the suppliants and
      fugitives, who had implored his protection. the gallic
      territories, which were possessed by the alemanni, became the
      prize of their conqueror; and the haughty nation, invincible, or
      rebellious, to the arms of rome, acknowledged the sovereignty of
      the merovingian kings, who graciously permitted them to enjoy
      their peculiar manners and institutions, under the government of
      official, and, at length, of hereditary, dukes. after the
      conquest of the western provinces, the franks alone maintained
      their ancient habitations beyond the rhine. they gradually
      subdued, and civilized, the exhausted countries, as far as the
      elbe, and the mountains of bohemia; and the peace of europe was
      secured by the obedience of germany. 24

      the grandson of clovis. the state of the alemanni under the

      germans, xi. 8, &c. annotation xxxvi.) and guilliman, (de reb.
      helvet. l. ii. c. 10-12, p. 72-80.)]

      till the thirtieth year of his age, clovis continued to worship
      the gods of his ancestors. 25 his disbelief, or rather disregard,
      of christianity, might encourage him to pillage with less remorse
      the churches of a hostile territory: but his subjects of gaul
      enjoyed the free exercise of religious worship; and the bishops
      entertained a more favorable hope of the idolater, than of the
      heretics. the merovingian prince had contracted a fortunate
      alliance with the fair clotilda, the niece of the king of
      burgundy, who, in the midst of an arian court, was educated in
      the profession of the catholic faith. it was her interest, as
      well as her duty, to achieve the conversion 26 of a pagan
      husband; and clovis insensibly listened to the voice of love and
      religion. he consented (perhaps such terms had been previously
      stipulated) to the baptism of his eldest son; and though the
      sudden death of the infant excited some superstitious fears, he
      was persuaded, a second time, to repeat the dangerous experiment.
      in the distress of the battle of tolbiac, clovis loudly invoked
      the god of clotilda and the christians; and victory disposed him
      to hear, with respectful gratitude, the eloquent 27 remigius, 28
      bishop of rheims, who forcibly displayed the temporal and
      spiritual advantages of his conversion. the king declared himself
      satisfied of the truth of the catholic faith; and the political
      reasons which might have suspended his public profession, were
      removed by the devout or loyal acclamations of the franks, who
      showed themselves alike prepared to follow their heroic leader to
      the field of battle, or to the baptismal font. the important
      ceremony was performed in the cathedral of rheims, with every
      circumstance of magnificence and solemnity that could impress an
      awful sense of religion on the minds of its rude proselytes. 29
      the new constantine was immediately baptized, with three thousand
      of his warlike subjects; and their example was imitated by the
      remainder of the gentle barbarians, who, in obedience to the
      victorious prelate, adored the cross which they had burnt, and
      burnt the idols which they had formerly adored. 30 the mind of
      clovis was susceptible of transient fervor: he was exasperated by
      the pathetic tale of the passion and death of christ; and,
      instead of weighing the salutary consequences of that mysterious
      sacrifice, he exclaimed, with indiscreet fury, had i been
      present at the head of my valiant franks, i would have revenged
      his injuries. 31 but the savage conqueror of gaul was incapable
      of examining the proofs of a religion, which depends on the
      laborious investigation of historic evidence and speculative
      theology. he was still more incapable of feeling the mild
      influence of the gospel, which persuades and purifies the heart
      of a genuine convert. his ambitious reign was a perpetual
      violation of moral and christian duties: his hands were stained
      with blood in peace as well as in war; and, as soon as clovis had
      dismissed a synod of the gallican church, he calmly assassinated
      all the princes of the merovingian race. 32 yet the king of the
      franks might sincerely worship the christian god, as a being more
      excellent and powerful than his national deities; and the signal
      deliverance and victory of tolbiac encouraged clovis to confide
      in the future protection of the lord of hosts. martin, the most
      popular of the saints, had filled the western world with the fame
      of those miracles which were incessantly performed at his holy
      sepulchre of tours. his visible or invisible aid promoted the
      cause of a liberal and orthodox prince; and the profane remark of
      clovis himself, that st.martin was an expensive friend, 33 need
      not be interpreted as the symptom of any permanent or rational
      scepticism. but earth, as well as heaven, rejoiced in the
      conversion of the franks. on the memorable day when clovis
      ascended from the baptismal font, he alone, in the christian
      world, deserved the name and prerogatives of a catholic king. the
      emperor anastasius entertained some dangerous errors concerning
      the nature of the divine incarnation; and the barbarians of
      italy, africa, spain, and gaul, were involved in the arian
      heresy. the eldest, or rather the only, son of the church, was
      acknowledged by the clergy as their lawful sovereign, or glorious
      deliverer; and the armies of clovis were strenuously supported by
      the zeal and fervor of the catholic faction. 34

      under the roman empire, the wealth and jurisdiction of the
      bishops, their sacred character, and perpetual office, their
      numerous dependants, popular eloquence, and provincial
      assemblies, had rendered them always respectable, and sometimes
      dangerous. their influence was augmented with the progress of
      superstition; and the establishment of the french monarchy may,
      in some degree, be ascribed to the firm alliance of a hundred
      prelates, who reigned in the discontented, or independent, cities
      of gaul. the slight foundations of the armorican republic had
      been repeatedly shaken, or overthrown; but the same people still
      guarded their domestic freedom; asserted the dignity of the roman
      name; and bravely resisted the predatory inroads, and regular
      attacks, of clovis, who labored to extend his conquests from the
      seine to the loire. their successful opposition introduced an
      equal and honorable union. the franks esteemed the valor of the
      armoricans 35 and the armoricans were reconciled by the religion
      of the franks. the military force which had been stationed for
      the defence of gaul, consisted of one hundred different bands of
      cavalry or infantry; and these troops, while they assumed the
      title and privileges of roman soldiers, were renewed by an
      incessant supply of the barbarian youth. the extreme
      fortifications, and scattered fragments of the empire, were still
      defended by their hopeless courage. but their retreat was
      intercepted, and their communication was impracticable: they were
      abandoned by the greek princes of constantinople, and they
      piously disclaimed all connection with the arian usurpers of
      gaul. they accepted, without shame or reluctance, the generous
      capitulation, which was proposed by a catholic hero; and this
      spurious, or legitimate, progeny of the roman legions, was
      distinguished in the succeeding age by their arms, their ensigns,
      and their peculiar dress and institutions. but the national
      strength was increased by these powerful and voluntary
      accessions; and the neighboring kingdoms dreaded the numbers, as
      well as the spirit, of the franks. the reduction of the northern
      provinces of gaul, instead of being decided by the chance of a
      single battle, appears to have been slowly effected by the
      gradual operation of war and treaty and clovis acquired each
      object of his ambition, by such efforts, or such concessions, as
      were adequate to its real value. his savage character, and the
      virtues of henry iv., suggest the most opposite ideas of human

      the kingdom of the burgundians, which was defined by the course
      of two gallic rivers, the saone and the rhone, extended from the
      forest of vosges to the alps and the sea of marscilles. 37 the
      sceptre was in the hands of gundobald. that valiant and ambitious
      prince had reduced the number of royal candidates by the death of
      two brothers, one of whom was the father of clotilda; 38 but his
      imperfect prudence still permitted godegisel, the youngest of his
      brothers, to possess the dependent principality of geneva. the
      arian monarch was justly alarmed by the satisfaction, and the
      hopes, which seemed to animate his clergy and people after the
      conversion of clovis; and gundobald convened at lyons an assembly
      of his bishops, to reconcile, if it were possible, their
      religious and political discontents. a vain conference was
      agitated between the two factions. the arians upbraided the
      catholics with the worship of three gods: the catholics defended
      their cause by theological distinctions; and the usual arguments,
      objections, and replies were reverberated with obstinate clamor;
      till the king revealed his secret apprehensions, by an abrupt but
      decisive question, which he addressed to the orthodox bishops.
      if you truly profess the christian religion, why do you not
      restrain the king of the franks? he has declared war against me,
      and forms alliances with my enemies for my destruction. a
      sanguinary and covetous mind is not the symptom of a sincere
      conversion: let him show his faith by his works. the answer of
      avitus, bishop of vienna, who spoke in the name of his brethren,
      was delivered with the voice and countenance of an angel. we are
      ignorant of the motives and intentions of the king of the franks:
      but we are taught by scripture, that the kingdoms which abandon
      the divine law are frequently subverted; and that enemies will
      arise on every side against those who have made god their enemy.
      return, with thy people, to the law of god, and he will give
      peace and security to thy dominions. the king of burgundy, who
      was not prepared to accept the condition which the catholics
      considered as essential to the treaty, delayed and dismissed the
      ecclesiastical conference; after reproaching his bishops, that
      clovis, their friend and proselyte, had privately tempted the
      allegiance of his brother. 39

      the allegiance of his brother was already seduced; and the
      obedience of godegisel, who joined the royal standard with the
      troops of geneva, more effectually promoted the success of the
      conspiracy. while the franks and burgundians contended with equal
      valor, his seasonable desertion decided the event of the battle;
      and as gundobald was faintly supported by the disaffected gauls,
      he yielded to the arms of clovis, and hastily retreated from the
      field, which appears to have been situate between langres and
      dijon. he distrusted the strength of dijon, a quadrangular
      fortress, encompassed by two rivers, and by a wall thirty feet
      high, and fifteen thick, with four gates, and thirty-three
      towers: 40 he abandoned to the pursuit of clovis the important
      cities of lyons and vienna; and gundobald still fled with
      precipitation, till he had reached avignon, at the distance of
      two hundred and fifty miles from the field of battle.

      a long siege and an artful negotiation, admonished the king of
      the franks of the danger and difficulty of his enterprise. he
      imposed a tribute on the burgundian prince, compelled him to
      pardon and reward his brothers treachery, and proudly returned
      to his own dominions, with the spoils and captives of the
      southern provinces. this splendid triumph was soon clouded by the
      intelligence, that gundobald had violated his recent obligations,
      and that the unfortunate godegisel, who was left at vienna with a
      garrison of five thousand franks, 41 had been besieged,
      surprised, and massacred by his inhuman brother. such an outrage
      might have exasperated the patience of the most peaceful
      sovereign; yet the conqueror of gaul dissembled the injury,
      released the tribute, and accepted the alliance, and military
      service, of the king of burgundy. clovis no longer possessed
      those advantages which had assured the success of the preceding
      war; and his rival, instructed by adversity, had found new
      resources in the affections of his people. the gauls or romans
      applauded the mild and impartial laws of gundobald, which almost
      raised them to the same level with their conquerors. the bishops
      were reconciled, and flattered, by the hopes, which he artfully
      suggested, of his approaching conversion; and though he eluded
      their accomplishment to the last moment of his life, his
      moderation secured the peace, and suspended the ruin, of the
      kingdom of burgundy. 42

      i am impatient to pursue the final ruin of that kingdom, which
      was accomplished under the reign of sigismond, the son of
      gundobald. the catholic sigismond has acquired the honors of a
      saint and martyr; 43 but the hands of the royal saint were
      stained with the blood of his innocent son, whom he inhumanly
      sacrificed to the pride and resentment of a step-mother. he soon
      discovered his error, and bewailed the irreparable loss. while
      sigismond embraced the corpse of the unfortunate youth, he
      received a severe admonition from one of his attendants: it is
      not his situation, o king! it is thine which deserves pity and
      lamentation. the reproaches of a guilty conscience were
      alleviated, however, by his liberal donations to the monastery of
      agaunum, or st. maurice, in vallais; which he himself had founded
      in honor of the imaginary martyrs of the thebaean legion. 44 a
      full chorus of perpetual psalmody was instituted by the pious
      king; he assiduously practised the austere devotion of the monks;
      and it was his humble prayer, that heaven would inflict in this
      world the punishment of his sins. his prayer was heard: the
      avengers were at hand: and the provinces of burgundy were
      overwhelmed by an army of victorious franks. after the event of
      an unsuccessful battle, sigismond, who wished to protract his
      life that he might prolong his penance, concealed himself in the
      desert in a religious habit, till he was discovered and betrayed
      by his subjects, who solicited the favor of their new masters.
      the captive monarch, with his wife and two children, was
      transported to orleans, and buried alive in a deep well, by the
      stern command of the sons of clovis; whose cruelty might derive
      some excuse from the maxims and examples of their barbarous age.
      their ambition, which urged them to achieve the conquest of
      burgundy, was inflamed, or disguised, by filial piety: and
      clotilda, whose sanctity did not consist in the forgiveness of
      injuries, pressed them to revenge her fathers death on the
      family of his assassin. the rebellious burgundians (for they
      attempted to break their chains) were still permitted to enjoy
      their national laws under the obligation of tribute and military
      service; and the merovingian princes peaceably reigned over a
      kingdom, whose glory and greatness had been first overthrown by
      the arms of clovis. 45

      the first victory of clovis had insulted the honor of the goths.
      they viewed his rapid progress with jealousy and terror; and the
      youthful fame of alaric was oppressed by the more potent genius
      of his rival. some disputes inevitably arose on the edge of their
      contiguous dominions; and after the delays of fruitless
      negotiation, a personal interview of the two kings was proposed
      and accepted. the conference of clovis and alaric was held in a
      small island of the loire, near amboise. they embraced,
      familiarly conversed, and feasted together; and separated with
      the warmest professions of peace and brotherly love. but their
      apparent confidence concealed a dark suspicion of hostile and
      treacherous designs; and their mutual complaints solicited,
      eluded, and disclaimed, a final arbitration. at paris, which he
      already considered as his royal seat, clovis declared to an
      assembly of the princes and warriors, the pretence, and the
      motive, of a gothic war. it grieves me to see that the arians
      still possess the fairest portion of gaul. let us march against
      them with the aid of god; and, having vanquished the heretics, we
      will possess and divide their fertile provinces. 46 the franks,
      who were inspired by hereditary valor and recent zeal, applauded
      the generous design of their monarch; expressed their resolution
      to conquer or die, since death and conquest would be equally
      profitable; and solemnly protested that they would never shave
      their beards till victory should absolve them from that
      inconvenient vow. the enterprise was promoted by the public or
      private exhortations of clotilda. she reminded her husband how
      effectually some pious foundation would propitiate the deity, and
      his servants: and the christian hero, darting his battle-axe with
      a skilful and nervous band, there, (said he,) on that spot where
      my francisca, 47 shall fall, will i erect a church in honor of
      the holy apostles. this ostentatious piety confirmed and
      justified the attachment of the catholics, with whom he secretly
      corresponded; and their devout wishes were gradually ripened into
      a formidable conspiracy. the people of aquitain were alarmed by
      the indiscreet reproaches of their gothic tyrants, who justly
      accused them of preferring the dominion of the franks: and their
      zealous adherent quintianus, bishop of rodez, 48 preached more
      forcibly in his exile than in his diocese. to resist these
      foreign and domestic enemies, who were fortified by the alliance
      of the burgundians, alaric collected his troops, far more
      numerous than the military powers of clovis. the visigoths
      resumed the exercise of arms, which they had neglected in a long
      and luxurious peace; 49 a select band of valiant and robust
      slaves attended their masters to the field; 50 and the cities of
      gaul were compelled to furnish their doubtful and reluctant aid.
      theodoric, king of the ostrogoths, who reigned in italy, had
      labored to maintain the tranquillity of gaul; and he assumed, or
      affected, for that purpose, the impartial character of a
      mediator. but the sagacious monarch dreaded the rising empire of
      clovis, and he was firmly engaged to support the national and
      religious cause of the goths.

      the accidental, or artificial, prodigies which adorned the
      expedition of clovis, were accepted by a superstitious age, as
      the manifest declaration of the divine favor. he marched from
      paris; and as he proceeded with decent reverence through the holy
      diocese of tours, his anxiety tempted him to consult the shrine
      of st. martin, the sanctuary and the oracle of gaul. his
      messengers were instructed to remark the words of the psalm which
      should happen to be chanted at the precise moment when they
      entered the church. those words most fortunately expressed the
      valor and victory of the champions of heaven, and the application
      was easily transferred to the new joshua, the new gideon, who
      went forth to battle against the enemies of the lord. 51 orleans
      secured to the franks a bridge on the loire; but, at the distance
      of forty miles from poitiers, their progress was intercepted by
      an extraordinary swell of the river vigenna or vienne; and the
      opposite banks were covered by the encampment of the visigoths.
      delay must be always dangerous to barbarians, who consume the
      country through which they march; and had clovis possessed
      leisure and materials, it might have been impracticable to
      construct a bridge, or to force a passage, in the face of a
      superior enemy. but the affectionate peasants who were impatient
      to welcome their deliverer, could easily betray some unknown or
      unguarded ford: the merit of the discovery was enhanced by the
      useful interposition of fraud or fiction; and a white hart, of
      singular size and beauty, appeared to guide and animate the march
      of the catholic army. the counsels of the visigoths were
      irresolute and distracted. a crowd of impatient warriors,
      presumptuous in their strength, and disdaining to fly before the
      robbers of germany, excited alaric to assert in arms the name and
      blood of the conquerors of rome. the advice of the graver
      chieftains pressed him to elude the first ardor of the franks;
      and to expect, in the southern provinces of gaul, the veteran and
      victorious ostrogoths, whom the king of italy had already sent to
      his assistance. the decisive moments were wasted in idle
      deliberation the goths too hastily abandoned, perhaps, an
      advantageous post; and the opportunity of a secure retreat was
      lost by their slow and disorderly motions. after clovis had
      passed the ford, as it is still named, of the hart, he advanced
      with bold and hasty steps to prevent the escape of the enemy. his
      nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor, suspended in
      the air above the cathedral of poitiers; and this signal, which
      might be previously concerted with the orthodox successor of st.
      hilary, was compared to the column of fire that guided the
      israelites in the desert. at the third hour of the day, about ten
      miles beyond poitiers, clovis overtook, and instantly attacked,
      the gothic army; whose defeat was already prepared by terror and
      confusion. yet they rallied in their extreme distress, and the
      martial youths, who had clamorously demanded the battle, refused
      to survive the ignominy of flight. the two kings encountered each
      other in single combat. alaric fell by the hand of his rival; and
      the victorious frank was saved by the goodness of his cuirass,
      and the vigor of his horse, from the spears of two desperate
      goths, who furiously rode against him to revenge the death of
      their sovereign. the vague expression of a mountain of the slain,
      serves to indicate a cruel though indefinite slaughter; but
      gregory has carefully observed, that his valiant countryman
      apollinaris, the son of sidonius, lost his life at the head of
      the nobles of auvergne. perhaps these suspected catholics had
      been maliciously exposed to the blind assault of the enemy; and
      perhaps the influence of religion was superseded by personal
      attachment or military honor. 52

      the south of poitiers. clovis overtook and attacked the visigoths
      near vivonne, and the victory was decided near a village still
      named champagne st. hilaire. see the dissertations of the abbe le

      such is the empire of fortune, (if we may still disguise our
      ignorance under that popular name,) that it is almost equally
      difficult to foresee the events of war, or to explain their
      various consequences. a bloody and complete victory has sometimes
      yielded no more than the possession of the field; and the loss of
      ten thousand men has sometimes been sufficient to destroy, in a
      single day, the work of ages. the decisive battle of poitiers was
      followed by the conquest of aquitain. alaric had left behind him
      an infant son, a bastard competitor, factious nobles, and a
      disloyal people; and the remaining forces of the goths were
      oppressed by the general consternation, or opposed to each other
      in civil discord. the victorious king of the franks proceeded
      without delay to the siege of angouleme. at the sound of his
      trumpets the walls of the city imitated the example of jericho,
      and instantly fell to the ground; a splendid miracle, which may
      be reduced to the supposition, that some clerical engineers had
      secretly undermined the foundations of the rampart. 53 at
      bordeaux, which had submitted without resistance, clovis
      established his winter quarters; and his prudent economy
      transported from thoulouse the royal treasures, which were
      deposited in the capital of the monarchy. the conqueror
      penetrated as far as the confines of spain; 54 restored the
      honors of the catholic church; fixed in aquitain a colony of
      franks; 55 and delegated to his lieutenants the easy task of
      subduing, or extirpating, the nation of the visigoths. but the
      visigoths were protected by the wise and powerful monarch of
      italy. while the balance was still equal, theodoric had perhaps
      delayed the march of the ostrogoths; but their strenuous efforts
      successfully resisted the ambition of clovis; and the army of the
      franks, and their burgundian allies, was compelled to raise the
      siege of arles, with the loss, as it is said, of thirty thousand
      men. these vicissitudes inclined the fierce spirit of clovis to
      acquiesce in an advantageous treaty of peace. the visigoths were
      suffered to retain the possession of septimania, a narrow tract
      of sea-coast, from the rhone to the pyrenees; but the ample
      province of aquitain, from those mountains to the loire, was
      indissolubly united to the kingdom of france. 56

      monk of amienssee the abbe le boeuf, mem. de lacademie, tom.
      xvii. p. 228-245) relates, in the allegorical character of a
      shepherd, the general history of his countrymen the franks; but
      his narrative ends with the death of clovis.]

      mulieribus. yet it should seem that they soon mingled with the
      romans of aquitain, till charlemagne introduced a more numerous
      and powerful colony, (dubos, hist. critique, tom. ii. p. 215.)]

      56 (return) [ in the composition of the gothic war, i have used

      after the success of the gothic war, clovis accepted the honors
      of the roman consulship. the emperor anastasius ambitiously
      bestowed on the most powerful rival of theodoric the title and
      ensigns of that eminent dignity; yet, from some unknown cause,
      the name of clovis has not been inscribed in the fasti either of
      the east or west. 57 on the solemn day, the monarch of gaul,
      placing a diadem on his head, was invested, in the church of st.
      martin, with a purple tunic and mantle. from thence he proceeded
      on horseback to the cathedral of tours; and, as he passed through
      the streets, profusely scattered, with his own hand, a donative
      of gold and silver to the joyful multitude, who incessantly
      repeated their acclamations of consul and augustus. the actual or
      legal authority of clovis could not receive any new accessions
      from the consular dignity. it was a name, a shadow, an empty
      pageant; and if the conqueror had been instructed to claim the
      ancient prerogatives of that high office, they must have expired
      with the period of its annual duration. but the romans were
      disposed to revere, in the person of their master, that antique
      title which the emperors condescended to assume: the barbarian
      himself seemed to contract a sacred obligation to respect the
      majesty of the republic; and the successors of theodosius, by
      soliciting his friendship, tacitly forgave, and almost ratified,
      the usurpation of gaul.

      57 (return) [ the fasti of italy would naturally reject a consul,
      the enemy of their sovereign; but any ingenious hypothesis that
      might explain the silence of constantinople and egypt, (the
      chronicle of marcellinus, and the paschal,) is overturned by the
      similar silence of marius, bishop of avenche, who composed his
      fasti in the kingdom of burgundy. if the evidence of gregory of
      tours were less weighty and positive, (l. ii. c. 38, in tom. ii.
      p. 183,) i could believe that clovis, like odoacer, received the
      lasting title and honors of patrician, (pagi critica, tom. ii. p.
      474, 492.)]

      twenty-five years after the death of clovis this important
      concession was more formally declared, in a treaty between his
      sons and the emperor justinian. the ostrogoths of italy, unable
      to defend their distant acquisitions, had resigned to the franks
      the cities of arles and marseilles; of arles, still adorned with
      the seat of a prtorian prfect, and of marseilles, enriched by
      the advantages of trade and navigation. 58 this transaction was
      confirmed by the imperial authority; and justinian, generously
      yielding to the franks the sovereignty of the countries beyond
      the alps, which they already possessed, absolved the provincials
      from their allegiance; and established on a more lawful, though
      not more solid, foundation, the throne of the merovingians. 59
      from that era they enjoyed the right of celebrating at arles the
      games of the circus; and by a singular privilege, which was
      denied even to the persian monarch, the gold coin, impressed with
      their name and image, obtained a legal currency in the empire. 60
      a greek historian of that age has praised the private and public
      virtues of the franks, with a partial enthusiasm, which cannot be
      sufficiently justified by their domestic annals. 61 he celebrates
      their politeness and urbanity, their regular government, and
      orthodox religion; and boldly asserts, that these barbarians
      could be distinguished only by their dress and language from the
      subjects of rome. perhaps the franks already displayed the social
      disposition, and lively graces, which, in every age, have
      disguised their vices, and sometimes concealed their intrinsic
      merit. perhaps agathias, and the greeks, were dazzled by the
      rapid progress of their arms, and the splendor of their empire.
      since the conquest of burgundy, gaul, except the gothic province
      of septimania, was subject, in its whole extent, to the sons of
      clovis. they had extinguished the german kingdom of thuringia,
      and their vague dominion penetrated beyond the rhine, into the
      heart of their native forests. the alemanni, and bavarians, who
      had occupied the roman provinces of rhaetia and noricum, to the
      south of the danube, confessed themselves the humble vassals of
      the franks; and the feeble barrier of the alps was incapable of
      resisting their ambition. when the last survivor of the sons of
      clovis united the inheritance and conquests of the merovingians,
      his kingdom extended far beyond the limits of modern france. yet
      modern france, such has been the progress of arts and policy, far
      surpasses, in wealth, populousness, and power, the spacious but
      savage realms of clotaire or dagobert. 62

      the syrians were established in gaul. see m. de guignes, mem. de

      franks established only a decuple proportion of gold and silver,
      ten shillings will be a sufficient valuation of their solidus of
      gold. it was the common standard of the barbaric fines, and
      contained forty denarii, or silver three pences. twelve of these
      denarii made a solidus, or shilling, the twentieth part of the
      ponderal and numeral livre, or pound of silver, which has been so
      strangely reduced in modern france. see la blanc, traite

      the franks, or french, are the only people of europe who can
      deduce a perpetual succession from the conquerors of the western
      empire. but their conquest of gaul was followed by ten centuries
      of anarchy and ignorance. on the revival of learning, the
      students, who had been formed in the schools of athens and rome,
      disdained their barbarian ancestors; and a long period elapsed
      before patient labor could provide the requisite materials to
      satisfy, or rather to excite, the curiosity of more enlightened
      times. 63 at length the eye of criticism and philosophy was
      directed to the antiquities of france; but even philosophers have
      been tainted by the contagion of prejudice and passion. the most
      extreme and exclusive systems, of the personal servitude of the
      gauls, or of their voluntary and equal alliance with the franks,
      have been rashly conceived, and obstinately defended; and the
      intemperate disputants have accused each other of conspiring
      against the prerogative of the crown, the dignity of the nobles,
      or the freedom of the people. yet the sharp conflict has usefully
      exercised the adverse powers of learning and genius; and each
      antagonist, alternately vanquished and victorious has extirpated
      some ancient errors, and established some interesting truths. an
      impartial stranger, instructed by their discoveries, their
      disputes, and even their faults, may describe, from the same
      original materials, the state of the roman provincials, after
      gaul had submitted to the arms and laws of the merovingian kings.

      heineccius, (opera, tom. iii. sylloge, iii. p. 248, &c.,) germany

      laws, which were published by heroldus, lindenbrogius, &c. at

      of gregory of tours, and all the monuments of the merovingian

      volumes of the historians of france.]

      64 (return) [ in the space of [about] thirty years (1728-1765)

      la france, particularly tom. i. p. 15-49;) the learned ingenuity
      of the abbe dubos, (histoire critique de letablissement de la
      monarchie francoise dans les gaules, 2 vols. in 4to;) the
      comprehensive genius of the president de montesquieu, (esprit des
      loix, particularly l. xxviii. xxx. xxxi.;) and the good sense and
      diligence of the abbe de mably, (observations sur lhistoire de
      france, 2 vols. 12mo.)]

      the rudest, or the most servile, condition of human society, is
      regulated, however, by some fixed and general rules. when tacitus
      surveyed the primitive simplicity of the germans, he discovered
      some permanent maxims, or customs, of public and private life,
      which were preserved by faithful tradition till the introduction
      of the art of writing, and of the latin tongue. 65 before the
      election of the merovingian kings, the most powerful tribe, or
      nation, of the franks, appointed four venerable chieftains to
      compose the salic laws; 66 and their labors were examined and
      approved in three successive assemblies of the people. after the
      baptism of clovis, he reformed several articles that appeared
      incompatible with christianity: the salic law was again amended
      by his sons; and at length, under the reign of dagobert, the code
      was revised and promulgated in its actual form, one hundred years
      after the establishment of the french monarchy. within the same
      period, the customs of the ripuarians were transcribed and
      published; and charlemagne himself, the legislator of his age and
      country, had accurately studied the two national laws, which
      still prevailed among the franks. 67 the same care was extended
      to their vassals; and the rude institutions of the alemanni and
      bavarians were diligently compiled and ratified by the supreme
      authority of the merovingian kings. the visigoths and
      burgundians, whose conquests in gaul preceded those of the
      franks, showed less impatience to attain one of the principal
      benefits of civilized society. euric was the first of the gothic
      princes who expressed, in writing, the manners and customs of his
      people; and the composition of the burgundian laws was a measure
      of policy rather than of justice; to alleviate the yoke, and
      regain the affections, of their gallic subjects. 68 thus, by a
      singular coincidence, the germans framed their artless
      institutions, at a time when the elaborate system of roman
      jurisprudence was finally consummated. in the salic laws, and the
      pandects of justinian, we may compare the first rudiments, and
      the full maturity, of civil wisdom; and whatever prejudices may
      be suggested in favor of barbarism, our calmer reflections will
      ascribe to the romans the superior advantages, not only of
      science and reason, but of humanity and justice. yet the laws 681
      of the barbarians were adapted to their wants and desires, their
      occupations and their capacity; and they all contributed to
      preserve the peace, and promote the improvement, of the society
      for whose use they were originally established. the merovingians,
      instead of imposing a uniform rule of conduct on their various
      subjects, permitted each people, and each family, of their
      empire, freely to enjoy their domestic institutions; 69 nor were
      the romans excluded from the common benefits of this legal
      toleration. 70 the children embraced the law of their parents,
      the wife that of her husband, the freedman that of his patron;
      and in all causes where the parties were of different nations,
      the plaintiff or accuser was obliged to follow the tribunal of
      the defendant, who may always plead a judicial presumption of
      right, or innocence. a more ample latitude was allowed, if every
      citizen, in the presence of the judge, might declare the law
      under which he desired to live, and the national society to which
      he chose to belong. such an indulgence would abolish the partial
      distinctions of victory: and the roman provincials might
      patiently acquiesce in the hardships of their condition; since it
      depended on themselves to assume the privilege, if they dared to
      assert the character, of free and warlike barbarians. 71

      works of heineccius, the history, and the elements, of the

      the four legislators; and many provinces, franconia, saxony,

      called the lex antiqua, or vetustior in which many german words
      are mingled with the latin, has no claim to superior antiquity,
      and may be suspected to be more modern. m. wiarda has been
      opposed by m. fuer bach, who maintains the higher age of the
      ancient code, which has been greatly corrupted by the
      transcribers. see guizot, cours de lhistoire moderne, vol. i.

      chapter xxxviii: reign of clovis.part iii.

      when justice inexorably requires the death of a murderer, each
      private citizen is fortified by the assurance, that the laws, the
      magistrate, and the whole community, are the guardians of his
      personal safety. but in the loose society of the germans, revenge
      was always honorable, and often meritorious: the independent
      warrior chastised, or vindicated, with his own hand, the injuries
      which he had offered or received; and he had only to dread the
      resentment of the sons and kinsmen of the enemy, whom he had
      sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions. the magistrate,
      conscious of his weakness, interposed, not to punish, but to
      reconcile; and he was satisfied if he could persuade or compel
      the contending parties to pay and to accept the moderate fine
      which had been ascertained as the price of blood. 72 the fierce
      spirit of the franks would have opposed a more rigorous sentence;
      the same fierceness despised these ineffectual restraints; and,
      when their simple manners had been corrupted by the wealth of
      gaul, the public peace was continually violated by acts of hasty
      or deliberate guilt. in every just government the same penalty is
      inflicted, or at least is imposed, for the murder of a peasant or
      a prince. but the national inequality established by the franks,
      in their criminal proceedings, was the last insult and abuse of
      conquest. 73 in the calm moments of legislation, they solemnly
      pronounced, that the life of a roman was of smaller value than
      that of a barbarian. the antrustion, 74 a name expressive of the
      most illustrious birth or dignity among the franks, was
      appreciated at the sum of six hundred pieces of gold; while the
      noble provincial, who was admitted to the kings table, might be
      legally murdered at the expense of three hundred pieces.

      two hundred were deemed sufficient for a frank of ordinary
      condition; but the meaner romans were exposed to disgrace and
      danger by a trifling compensation of one hundred, or even fifty,
      pieces of gold. had these laws been regulated by any principle of
      equity or reason, the public protection should have supplied, in
      just proportion, the want of personal strength. but the
      legislator had weighed in the scale, not of justice, but of
      policy, the loss of a soldier against that of a slave: the head
      of an insolent and rapacious barbarian was guarded by a heavy
      fine; and the slightest aid was afforded to the most defenceless
      subjects. time insensibly abated the pride of the conquerors and
      the patience of the vanquished; and the boldest citizen was
      taught, by experience, that he might suffer more injuries than he
      could inflict. as the manners of the franks became less
      ferocious, their laws were rendered more severe; and the
      merovingian kings attempted to imitate the impartial rigor of the
      visigoths and burgundians. 75 under the empire of charlemagne,
      murder was universally punished with death; and the use of
      capital punishments has been liberally multiplied in the
      jurisprudence of modern europe. 76

      the civil and military professions, which had been separated by
      constantine, were again united by the barbarians. the harsh sound
      of the teutonic appellations was mollified into the latin titles
      of duke, of count, or of praefect; and the same officer assumed,
      within his district, the command of the troops, and the
      administration of justice. 77 but the fierce and illiterate
      chieftain was seldom qualified to discharge the duties of a
      judge, which required all the faculties of a philosophic mind,
      laboriously cultivated by experience and study; and his rude
      ignorance was compelled to embrace some simple, and visible,
      methods of ascertaining the cause of justice. in every religion,
      the deity has been invoked to confirm the truth, or to punish the
      falsehood of human testimony; but this powerful instrument was
      misapplied and abused by the simplicity of the german
      legislators. the party accused might justify his innocence, by
      producing before their tribunal a number of friendly witnesses,
      who solemnly declared their belief, or assurance, that he was not
      guilty. according to the weight of the charge, this legal number
      of compurgators was multiplied; seventy-two voices were required
      to absolve an incendiary or assassin: and when the chastity of a
      queen of france was suspected, three hundred gallant nobles
      swore, without hesitation, that the infant prince had been
      actually begotten by her deceased husband. 78 the sin and scandal
      of manifest and frequent perjuries engaged the magistrates to
      remove these dangerous temptations; and to supply the defects of
      human testimony by the famous experiments of fire and water.
      these extraordinary trials were so capriciously contrived, that,
      in some cases, guilt, and innocence in others, could not be
      proved without the interposition of a miracle. such miracles were
      really provided by fraud and credulity; the most intricate causes
      were determined by this easy and infallible method, and the
      turbulent barbarians, who might have disdained the sentence of
      the magistrate, submissively acquiesced in the judgment of god.

      credit and authority, among a warlike people, who could not
      believe that a brave man deserved to suffer, or that a coward
      deserved to live. 80 both in civil and criminal proceedings, the
      plaintiff, or accuser, the defendant, or even the witness, were
      exposed to mortal challenge from the antagonist who was destitute
      of legal proofs; and it was incumbent on them either to desert
      their cause, or publicly to maintain their honor, in the lists of
      battle. they fought either on foot, or on horseback, according to
      the custom of their nation; 81 and the decision of the sword, or
      lance, was ratified by the sanction of heaven, of the judge, and
      of the people. this sanguinary law was introduced into gaul by
      the burgundians; and their legislator gundobald 82 condescended
      to answer the complaints and objections of his subject avitus.

      the event of national wars, and private combats, is directed by

      to the juster cause? by such prevailing arguments, the absurd
      and cruel practice of judicial duels, which had been peculiar to
      some tribes of germany, was propagated and established in all the
      monarchies of europe, from sicily to the baltic. at the end of
      ten centuries, the reign of legal violence was not totally
      extinguished; and the ineffectual censures of saints, of popes,
      and of synods, may seem to prove, that the influence of
      superstition is weakened by its unnatural alliance with reason
      and humanity. the tribunals were stained with the blood, perhaps,
      of innocent and respectable citizens; the law, which now favors
      the rich, then yielded to the strong; and the old, the feeble,
      and the infirm, were condemned, either to renounce their fairest
      claims and possessions, to sustain the dangers of an unequal
      conflict, 83 or to trust the doubtful aid of a mercenary
      champion. this oppressive jurisprudence was imposed on the
      provincials of gaul, who complained of any injuries in their
      persons and property. whatever might be the strength, or courage,
      of individuals, the victorious barbarians excelled in the love
      and exercise of arms; and the vanquished roman was unjustly

      a devouring host of one hundred and twenty thousand germans had
      formerly passed the rhine under the command of ariovistus. one
      third part of the fertile lands of the sequani was appropriated
      to their use; and the conqueror soon repeated his oppressive
      demand of another third, for the accommodation of a new colony of
      twenty-four thousand barbarians, whom he had invited to share the
      rich harvest of gaul. 85 at the distance of five hundred years,
      the visigoths and burgundians, who revenged the defeat of
      ariovistus, usurped the same unequal proportion of two thirds of
      the subject lands. but this distribution, instead of spreading
      over the province, may be reasonably confined to the peculiar
      districts where the victorious people had been planted by their
      own choice, or by the policy of their leader. in these districts,
      each barbarian was connected by the ties of hospitality with some
      roman provincial. to this unwelcome guest, the proprietor was
      compelled to abandon two thirds of his patrimony, but the german,
      a shepherd and a hunter, might sometimes content himself with a
      spacious range of wood and pasture, and resign the smallest,
      though most valuable, portion, to the toil of the industrious
      husbandman. 86 the silence of ancient and authentic testimony has
      encouraged an opinion, that the rapine of the franks was not
      moderated, or disguised, by the forms of a legal division; that
      they dispersed themselves over the provinces of gaul, without
      order or control; and that each victorious robber, according to
      his wants, his avarice, and his strength, measured with his sword
      the extent of his new inheritance. at a distance from their
      sovereign, the barbarians might indeed be tempted to exercise
      such arbitrary depredation; but the firm and artful policy of
      clovis must curb a licentious spirit, which would aggravate the
      misery of the vanquished, whilst it corrupted the union and
      discipline of the conquerors. 861 the memorable vase of soissons
      is a monument and a pledge of the regular distribution of the
      gallic spoils. it was the duty and the interest of clovis to
      provide rewards for a successful army, settlements for a numerous
      people; without inflicting any wanton or superfluous injuries on
      the loyal catholics of gaul. the ample fund, which he might
      lawfully acquire, of the imperial patrimony, vacant lands, and
      gothic usurpations, would diminish the cruel necessity of seizure
      and confiscation, and the humble provincials would more patiently
      acquiesce in the equal and regular distribution of their loss. 87

      the wealth of the merovingian princes consisted in their
      extensive domain. after the conquest of gaul, they still
      delighted in the rustic simplicity of their ancestors; the cities
      were abandoned to solitude and decay; and their coins, their
      charters, and their synods, are still inscribed with the names of
      the villas, or rural palaces, in which they successively resided.

      one hundred and sixty of these palaces, a title which need not
      excite any unseasonable ideas of art or luxury, were scattered
      through the provinces of their kingdom; and if some might claim
      the honors of a fortress, the far greater part could be esteemed
      only in the light of profitable farms. the mansion of the
      long-haired kings was surrounded with convenient yards and
      stables, for the cattle and the poultry; the garden was planted
      with useful vegetables; the various trades, the labors of
      agriculture, and even the arts of hunting and fishing, were
      exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign;
      his magazines were filled with corn and wine, either for sale or
      consumption; and the whole administration was conducted by the
      strictest maxims of private economy. 88 this ample patrimony was
      appropriated to supply the hospitable plenty of clovis and his
      successors; and to reward the fidelity of their brave companions
      who, both in peace and war, were devoted to their personal
      service. instead of a horse, or a suit of armor, each companion,
      according to his rank, or merit, or favor, was invested with a
      benefice, the primitive name, and most simple form, of the feudal
      possessions. these gifts might be resumed at the pleasure of the
      sovereign; and his feeble prerogative derived some support from
      the influence of his liberality. 881 but this dependent tenure
      was gradually abolished 89 by the independent and rapacious
      nobles of france, who established the perpetual property, and
      hereditary succession, of their benefices; a revolution salutary
      to the earth, which had been injured, or neglected, by its
      precarious masters. 90 besides these royal and beneficiary
      estates, a large proportion had been assigned, in the division of

      according to the maxims of ancient war, the conqueror became the
      lawful master of the enemy whom he had subdued and spared: 96 and
      the fruitful cause of personal slavery, which had been almost
      suppressed by the peaceful sovereignty of rome, was again revived
      and multiplied by the perpetual hostilities of the independent
      barbarians. the goth, the burgundian, or the frank, who returned
      from a successful expedition, dragged after him a long train of
      sheep, of oxen, and of human captives, whom he treated with the
      same brutal contempt. the youths of an elegant form and an
      ingenuous aspect were set apart for the domestic service; a
      doubtful situation, which alternately exposed them to the
      favorable or cruel impulse of passion. the useful mechanics and
      servants (smiths, carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, cooks,
      gardeners, dyers, and workmen in gold and silver, &c.) employed
      their skill for the use, or profit, of their master. but the
      roman captives, who were destitute of art, but capable of labor,
      were condemned, without regard to their former rank, to tend the
      cattle and cultivate the lands of the barbarians. the number of
      the hereditary bondsmen, who were attached to the gallic estates,
      was continually increased by new supplies; and the servile
      people, according to the situation and temper of their lords, was
      sometimes raised by precarious indulgence, and more frequently
      depressed by capricious despotism. 97 an absolute power of life
      and death was exercised by these lords; and when they married
      their daughters, a train of useful servants, chained on the
      wagons to prevent their escape, was sent as a nuptial present
      into a distant country. 98 the majesty of the roman laws
      protected the liberty of each citizen, against the rash effects
      of his own distress or despair. but the subjects of the
      merovingian kings might alienate their personal freedom; and this
      act of legal suicide, which was familiarly practised, is
      expressed in terms most disgraceful and afflicting to the dignity
      of human nature. 99 the example of the poor, who purchased life
      by the sacrifice of all that can render life desirable, was
      gradually imitated by the feeble and the devout, who, in times of
      public disorder, pusillanimously crowded to shelter themselves
      under the battlements of a powerful chief, and around the shrine
      of a popular saint. their submission was accepted by these
      temporal or spiritual patrons; and the hasty transaction
      irrecoverably fixed their own condition, and that of their latest
      posterity. from the reign of clovis, during five successive
      centuries, the laws and manners of gaul uniformly tended to
      promote the increase, and to confirm the duration, of personal
      servitude. time and violence almost obliterated the intermediate
      ranks of society; and left an obscure and narrow interval between
      the noble and the slave. this arbitrary and recent division has
      been transformed by pride and prejudice into a national
      distinction, universally established by the arms and the laws of
      the merovingians. the nobles, who claimed their genuine or
      fabulous descent from the independent and victorious franks, have
      asserted and abused the indefeasible right of conquest over a
      prostrate crowd of slaves and plebeians, to whom they imputed the
      imaginary disgrace of gallic or roman extraction.

      the general state and revolutions of france, a name which was
      imposed by the conquerors, may be illustrated by the particular
      example of a province, a diocese, or a senatorial family.
      auvergne had formerly maintained a just preeminence among the
      independent states and cities of gaul. the brave and numerous
      inhabitants displayed a singular trophy; the sword of caesar
      himself, which he had lost when he was repulsed before the walls
      of gergovia. 100 as the common offspring of troy, they claimed a
      fraternal alliance with the romans; 101 and if each province had
      imitated the courage and loyalty of auvergne, the fall of the
      western empire might have been prevented or delayed. they firmly
      maintained the fidelity which they had reluctantly sworn to the
      visigoths, out when their bravest nobles had fallen in the battle
      of poitiers, they accepted, without resistance, a victorious and
      catholic sovereign. this easy and valuable conquest was achieved
      and possessed by theodoric, the eldest son of clovis: but the
      remote province was separated from his austrasian dominions, by
      the intermediate kingdoms of soissons, paris, and orleans, which
      formed, after their fathers death, the inheritance of his three
      brothers. the king of paris, childebert, was tempted by the
      neighborhood and beauty of auvergne. 102 the upper country, which
      rises towards the south into the mountains of the cevennes,
      presented a rich and various prospect of woods and pastures; the
      sides of the hills were clothed with vines; and each eminence was
      crowned with a villa or castle. in the lower auvergne, the river
      allier flows through the fair and spacious plain of limagne; and
      the inexhaustible fertility of the soil supplied, and still
      supplies, without any interval of repose, the constant repetition
      of the same harvests. 103 on the false report, that their lawful
      sovereign had been slain in germany, the city and diocese of
      auvergne were betrayed by the grandson of sidonius apollinaris.
      childebert enjoyed this clandestine victory; and the free
      subjects of theodoric threatened to desert his standard, if he
      indulged his private resentment, while the nation was engaged in
      the burgundian war. but the franks of austrasia soon yielded to
      the persuasive eloquence of their king. follow me, said
      theodoric, into auvergne; i will lead you into a province, where
      you may acquire gold, silver, slaves, cattle, and precious
      apparel, to the full extent of your wishes. i repeat my promise;
      i give you the people and their wealth as your prey; and you may
      transport them at pleasure into your own country. by the
      execution of this promise, theodoric justly forfeited the
      allegiance of a people whom he devoted to destruction. his
      troops, reenforced by the fiercest barbarians of germany, 104
      spread desolation over the fruitful face of auvergne; and two
      places only, a strong castle and a holy shrine, were saved or
      redeemed from their licentious fury. the castle of meroliac 105
      was seated on a lofty rock, which rose a hundred feet above the
      surface of the plain; and a large reservoir of fresh water was
      enclosed, with some arable lands, within the circle of its
      fortifications. the franks beheld with envy and despair this
      impregnable fortress; but they surprised a party of fifty
      stragglers; and, as they were oppressed by the number of their
      captives, they fixed, at a trifling ransom, the alternative of
      life or death for these wretched victims, whom the cruel
      barbarians were prepared to massacre on the refusal of the
      garrison. another detachment penetrated as far as brivas, or
      brioude, where the inhabitants, with their valuable effects, had
      taken refuge in the sanctuary of st. julian. the doors of the
      church resisted the assault; but a daring soldier entered through
      a window of the choir, and opened a passage to his companions.
      the clergy and people, the sacred and the profane spoils, were
      rudely torn from the altar; and the sacrilegious division was
      made at a small distance from the town of brioude. but this act
      of impiety was severely chastised by the devout son of clovis. he
      punished with death the most atrocious offenders; left their
      secret accomplices to the vengeance of st. julian; released the
      captives; restored the plunder; and extended the rights of
      sanctuary five miles round the sepulchre of the holy martyr. 106

      chapter xxxviii: reign of clovis.part iv.

      before the austrasian army retreated from auvergne, theodoric
      exacted some pledges of the future loyalty of a people, whose
      just hatred could be restrained only by their fear. a select band
      of noble youths, the sons of the principal senators, was
      delivered to the conqueror, as the hostages of the faith of
      childebert, and of their countrymen. on the first rumor of war,
      or conspiracy, these guiltless youths were reduced to a state of
      servitude; and one of them, attalus, 107 whose adventures are
      more particularly related, kept his masters horses in the
      diocese of treves. after a painful search, he was discovered, in
      this unworthy occupation, by the emissaries of his grandfather,
      gregory bishop of langres; but his offers of ransom were sternly
      rejected by the avarice of the barbarian, who required an
      exorbitant sum of ten pounds of gold for the freedom of his noble
      captive. his deliverance was effected by the hardy stratagem of
      leo, a slave belonging to the kitchens of the bishop of langres.
      108 an unknown agent easily introduced him into the same family.
      the barbarian purchased leo for the price of twelve pieces of
      gold; and was pleased to learn that he was deeply skilled in the
      luxury of an episcopal table: next sunday, said the frank, i
      shall invite my neighbors and kinsmen. exert thy art, and force
      them to confess, that they have never seen, or tasted, such an
      entertainment, even in the kings house. leo assured him, that
      if he would provide a sufficient quantity of poultry, his wishes
      should be satisfied. the master who already aspired to the merit
      of elegant hospitality, assumed, as his own, the praise which the
      voracious guests unanimously bestowed on his cook; and the
      dexterous leo insensibly acquired the trust and management of his
      household. after the patient expectation of a whole year, he
      cautiously whispered his design to attalus, and exhorted him to
      prepare for flight in the ensuing night. at the hour of midnight,
      the intemperate guests retired from the table; and the franks
      son-in-law, whom leo attended to his apartment with a nocturnal
      potation, condescended to jest on the facility with which he
      might betray his trust. the intrepid slave, after sustaining this
      dangerous raillery, entered his masters bedchamber; removed his
      spear and shield; silently drew the fleetest horses from the
      stable; unbarred the ponderous gates; and excited attalus to save
      his life and liberty by incessant diligence. their apprehensions
      urged them to leave their horses on the banks of the meuse; 109
      they swam the river, wandered three days in the adjacent forest,
      and subsisted only by the accidental discovery of a wild
      plum-tree. as they lay concealed in a dark thicket, they heard
      the noise of horses; they were terrified by the angry countenance
      of their master, and they anxiously listened to his declaration,
      that, if he could seize the guilty fugitives, one of them he
      would cut in pieces with his sword, and would expose the other on
      a gibbet. a length, attalus and his faithful leo reached the
      friendly habitation of a presbyter of rheims, who recruited their
      fainting strength with bread and wine, concealed them from the
      search of their enemy, and safely conducted them beyond the
      limits of the austrasian kingdom, to the episcopal palace of
      langres. gregory embraced his grandson with tears of joy,
      gratefully delivered leo, with his whole family, from the yoke of
      servitude, and bestowed on him the property of a farm, where he
      might end his days in happiness and freedom. perhaps this
      singular adventure, which is marked with so many circumstances of
      truth and nature, was related by attalus himself, to his cousin
      or nephew, the first historian of the franks. gregory of tours
      110 was born about sixty years after the death of sidonius
      apollinaris; and their situation was almost similar, since each
      of them was a native of auvergne, a senator, and a bishop. the
      difference of their style and sentiments may, therefore, express
      the decay of gaul; and clearly ascertain how much, in so short a
      space, the human mind had lost of its energy and refinement. 111

      we are now qualified to despise the opposite, and, perhaps,
      artful, misrepresentations, which have softened, or exaggerated,
      the oppression of the romans of gaul under the reign of the
      merovingians. the conquerors never promulgated any universal
      edict of servitude, or confiscation; but a degenerate people, who
      excused their weakness by the specious names of politeness and
      peace, was exposed to the arms and laws of the ferocious
      barbarians, who contemptuously insulted their possessions, their
      freedom, and their safety. their personal injuries were partial
      and irregular; but the great body of the romans survived the
      revolution, and still preserved the property, and privileges, of
      citizens. a large portion of their lands was exacted for the use
      of the franks: but they enjoyed the remainder, exempt from
      tribute; 112 and the same irresistible violence which swept away
      the arts and manufactures of gaul, destroyed the elaborate and
      expensive system of imperial despotism. the provincials must
      frequently deplore the savage jurisprudence of the salic or
      ripuarian laws; but their private life, in the important concerns
      of marriage, testaments, or inheritance, was still regulated by
      the theodosian code; and a discontented roman might freely
      aspire, or descend, to the title and character of a barbarian.
      the honors of the state were accessible to his ambition: the
      education and temper of the romans more peculiarly qualified them
      for the offices of civil government; and, as soon as emulation
      had rekindled their military ardor, they were permitted to march
      in the ranks, or even at the head, of the victorious germans. i
      shall not attempt to enumerate the generals and magistrates,
      whose names 113 attest the liberal policy of the merovingians.
      the supreme command of burgundy, with the title of patrician, was
      successively intrusted to three romans; and the last, and most
      powerful, mummolus, 114 who alternately saved and disturbed the
      monarchy, had supplanted his father in the station of count of
      autun, and left a treasury of thirty talents of gold, and two
      hundred and fifty talents of silver. the fierce and illiterate
      barbarians were excluded, during several generations, from the
      dignities, and even from the orders, of the church. 115 the
      clergy of gaul consisted almost entirely of native provincials;
      the haughty franks fell at the feet of their subjects, who were
      dignified with the episcopal character: and the power and riches
      which had been lost in war, were insensibly recovered by
      superstition. 116 in all temporal affairs, the theodosian code
      was the universal law of the clergy; but the barbaric
      jurisprudence had liberally provided for their personal safety; a
      sub-deacon was equivalent to two franks; the antrustion, and
      priest, were held in similar estimation: and the life of a bishop
      was appreciated far above the common standard, at the price of
      nine hundred pieces of gold. 117 the romans communicated to their
      conquerors the use of the christian religion and latin language;
      118 but their language and their religion had alike degenerated
      from the simple purity of the augustan, and apostolic age. the
      progress of superstition and barbarism was rapid and universal:
      the worship of the saints concealed from vulgar eyes the god of
      the christians; and the rustic dialect of peasants and soldiers
      was corrupted by a teutonic idiom and pronunciation. yet such
      intercourse of sacred and social communion eradicated the
      distinctions of birth and victory; and the nations of gaul were
      gradually confounded under the name and government of the franks.

      the franks, after they mingled with their gallic subjects, might
      have imparted the most valuable of human gifts, a spirit and
      system of constitutional liberty. under a king, hereditary, but
      limited, the chiefs and counsellors might have debated at paris,
      in the palace of the caesars: the adjacent field, where the
      emperors reviewed their mercenary legions, would have admitted
      the legislative assembly of freemen and warriors; and the rude
      model, which had been sketched in the woods of germany, 119 might
      have been polished and improved by the civil wisdom of the
      romans. but the careless barbarians, secure of their personal
      independence, disdained the labor of government: the annual
      assemblies of the month of march were silently abolished; and the
      nation was separated, and almost dissolved, by the conquest of
      gaul. 120 the monarchy was left without any regular establishment
      of justice, of arms, or of revenue. the successors of clovis
      wanted resolution to assume, or strength to exercise, the
      legislative and executive powers, which the people had abdicated:
      the royal prerogative was distinguished only by a more ample
      privilege of rapine and murder; and the love of freedom, so often
      invigorated and disgraced by private ambition, was reduced, among
      the licentious franks, to the contempt of order, and the desire
      of impunity. seventy-five years after the death of clovis, his
      grandson, gontran, king of burgundy, sent an army to invade the
      gothic possessions of septimania, or languedoc. the troops of
      burgundy, berry, auvergne, and the adjacent territories, were
      excited by the hopes of spoil. they marched, without discipline,
      under the banners of german, or gallic, counts: their attack was
      feeble and unsuccessful; but the friendly and hostile provinces
      were desolated with indiscriminate rage. the cornfields, the
      villages, the churches themselves, were consumed by fire: the
      inhabitants were massacred, or dragged into captivity; and, in
      the disorderly retreat, five thousand of these inhuman savages
      were destroyed by hunger or intestine discord. when the pious
      gontran reproached the guilt or neglect of their leaders, and
      threatened to inflict, not a legal sentence, but instant and
      arbitrary execution, they accused the universal and incurable
      corruption of the people. no one, they said, any longer fears
      or respects his king, his duke, or his count. each man loves to
      do evil, and freely indulges his criminal inclinations. the most
      gentle correction provokes an immediate tumult, and the rash
      magistrate, who presumes to censure or restrain his seditious
      subjects, seldom escapes alive from their revenge. 121 it has
      been reserved for the same nation to expose, by their intemperate
      vices, the most odious abuse of freedom; and to supply its loss
      by the spirit of honor and humanity, which now alleviates and
      dignifies their obedience to an absolute sovereign. 1211

      the visigoths had resigned to clovis the greatest part of their
      gallic possessions; but their loss was amply compensated by the
      easy conquest, and secure enjoyment, of the provinces of spain.
      from the monarchy of the goths, which soon involved the suevic
      kingdom of gallicia, the modern spaniards still derive some
      national vanity; but the historian of the roman empire is neither
      invited, nor compelled, to pursue the obscure and barren series
      of their annals. 122 the goths of spain were separated from the
      rest of mankind by the lofty ridge of the pyrenaean mountains:
      their manners and institutions, as far as they were common to the
      germanic tribes, have been already explained. i have anticipated,
      in the preceding chapter, the most important of their
      ecclesiastical events, the fall of arianism, and the persecution
      of the jews; and it only remains to observe some interesting
      circumstances which relate to the civil and ecclesiastical
      constitution of the spanish kingdom.

      history of the visigoths is contained in the short and imperfect
      chronicles of isidore of seville and john of biclar]

      after their conversion from idolatry or heresy, the frank and the
      visigoths were disposed to embrace, with equal submission, the
      inherent evils and the accidental benefits, of superstition. but
      the prelates of france, long before the extinction of the
      merovingian race, had degenerated into fighting and hunting
      barbarians. they disdained the use of synods; forgot the laws of
      temperance and chastity; and preferred the indulgence of private
      ambition and luxury to the general interest of the sacerdotal
      profession. 123 the bishops of spain respected themselves, and
      were respected by the public: their indissoluble union disguised
      their vices, and confirmed their authority; and the regular
      discipline of the church introduced peace, order, and stability,
      into the government of the state. from the reign of recared, the
      first catholic king, to that of witiza, the immediate predecessor
      of the unfortunate roderic, sixteen national councils were
      successively convened. the six metropolitans, toledo, seville,
      merida, braga, tarragona, and narbonne, presided according to
      their respective seniority; the assembly was composed of their
      suffragan bishops, who appeared in person, or by their proxies;
      and a place was assigned to the most holy, or opulent, of the
      spanish abbots. during the first three days of the convocation,
      as long as they agitated the ecclesiastical question of doctrine
      and discipline, the profane laity was excluded from their
      debates; which were conducted, however, with decent solemnity.
      but, on the morning of the fourth day, the doors were thrown open
      for the entrance of the great officers of the palace, the dukes
      and counts of the provinces, the judges of the cities, and the
      gothic nobles, and the decrees of heaven were ratified by the
      consent of the people.

      the same rules were observed in the provincial assemblies, the
      annual synods, which were empowered to hear complaints, and to
      redress grievances; and a legal government was supported by the
      prevailing influence of the spanish clergy. the bishops, who, in
      each revolution, were prepared to flatter the victorious, and to
      insult the prostrate labored, with diligence and success, to
      kindle the flames of persecution, and to exalt the mitre above
      the crown. yet the national councils of toledo, in which the free
      spirit of the barbarians was tempered and guided by episcopal
      policy, have established some prudent laws for the common benefit
      of the king and people. the vacancy of the throne was supplied by
      the choice of the bishops and palatines; and after the failure of
      the line of alaric, the regal dignity was still limited to the
      pure and noble blood of the goths. the clergy, who anointed their
      lawful prince, always recommended, and sometimes practised, the
      duty of allegiance; and the spiritual censures were denounced on
      the heads of the impious subjects, who should resist his
      authority, conspire against his life, or violate, by an indecent
      union, the chastity even of his widow. but the monarch himself,
      when he ascended the throne, was bound by a reciprocal oath to
      god and his people, that he would faithfully execute this
      important trust. the real or imaginary faults of his
      administration were subject to the control of a powerful
      aristocracy; and the bishops and palatines were guarded by a
      fundamental privilege, that they should not be degraded,
      imprisoned, tortured, nor punished with death, exile, or
      confiscation, unless by the free and public judgment of their
      peers. 124

      corruption, would seem to insinuate that the barbarians were
      admitted into the clergy about the year 660.]

      xv. 29, and annotations, xxvi. and xxxiii.) and ferreras (hist.
      generale de lespagne, tom. ii.) very useful and accurate
      guides.]

      one of these legislative councils of toledo examined and ratified
      the code of laws which had been compiled by a succession of
      gothic kings, from the fierce euric, to the devout egica. as long
      as the visigoths themselves were satisfied with the rude customs
      of their ancestors, they indulged their subjects of aquitain and
      spain in the enjoyment of the roman law. their gradual
      improvement in arts, in policy, and at length in religion,
      encouraged them to imitate, and to supersede, these foreign
      institutions; and to compose a code of civil and criminal
      jurisprudence, for the use of a great and united people. the same
      obligations, and the same privileges, were communicated to the
      nations of the spanish monarchy; and the conquerors, insensibly
      renouncing the teutonic idiom, submitted to the restraints of
      equity, and exalted the romans to the participation of freedom.
      the merit of this impartial policy was enhanced by the situation
      of spain under the reign of the visigoths. the provincials were
      long separated from their arian masters by the irreconcilable
      difference of religion. after the conversion of recared had
      removed the prejudices of the catholics, the coasts, both of the
      ocean and mediterranean, were still possessed by the eastern
      emperors; who secretly excited a discontented people to reject
      the yoke of the barbarians, and to assert the name and dignity of
      roman citizens. the allegiance of doubtful subjects is indeed
      most effectually secured by their own persuasion, that they
      hazard more in a revolt, than they can hope to obtain by a
      revolution; but it has appeared so natural to oppress those whom
      we hate and fear, that the contrary system well deserves the
      praise of wisdom and moderation. 125

      while the kingdom of the franks and visigoths were established in
      gaul and spain, the saxons achieved the conquest of britain, the
      third great diocese of the praefecture of the west. since britain
      was already separated from the roman empire, i might, without
      reproach, decline a story familiar to the most illiterate, and
      obscure to the most learned, of my readers. the saxons, who
      excelled in the use of the oar, or the battle-axe, were ignorant
      of the art which could alone perpetuate the fame of their
      exploits; the provincials, relapsing into barbarism, neglected to
      describe the ruin of their country; and the doubtful tradition
      was almost extinguished, before the missionaries of rome restored
      the light of science and christianity. the declamations of
      gildas, the fragments, or fables, of nennius, the obscure hints
      of the saxon laws and chronicles, and the ecclesiastical tales of
      the venerable bede, 126 have been illustrated by the diligence,
      and sometimes embellished by the fancy, of succeeding writers,
      whose works i am not ambitious either to censure or to
      transcribe. 127 yet the historian of the empire may be tempted to
      pursue the revolutions of a roman province, till it vanishes from
      his sight; and an englishman may curiously trace the
      establishment of the barbarians, from whom he derives his name,
      his laws, and perhaps his origin.

      about forty years after the dissolution of the roman government,
      vortigern appears to have obtained the supreme, though precarious
      command of the princes and cities of britain. that unfortunate
      monarch has been almost unanimously condemned for the weak and
      mischievous policy of inviting 128 a formidable stranger, to
      repel the vexatious inroads of a domestic foe. his ambassadors
      are despatched, by the gravest historians, to the coast of
      germany: they address a pathetic oration to the general assembly
      of the saxons, and those warlike barbarians resolve to assist
      with a fleet and army the suppliants of a distant and unknown
      island. if britain had indeed been unknown to the saxons, the
      measure of its calamities would have been less complete. but the
      strength of the roman government could not always guard the
      maritime province against the pirates of germany; the independent
      and divided states were exposed to their attacks; and the saxons
      might sometimes join the scots and the picts, in a tacit, or
      express, confederacy of rapine and destruction. vortigern could
      only balance the various perils, which assaulted on every side
      his throne and his people; and his policy may deserve either
      praise or excuse, if he preferred the alliance of those
      barbarians, whose naval power rendered them the most dangerous
      enemies and the most serviceable allies. hengist and horsa, as
      they ranged along the eastern coast with three ships, were
      engaged, by the promise of an ample stipend, to embrace the
      defence of britain; and their intrepid valor soon delivered the
      country from the caledonian invaders. the isle of thanet, a
      secure and fertile district, was allotted for the residence of
      these german auxiliaries, and they were supplied, according to
      the treaty, with a plentiful allowance of clothing and
      provisions. this favorable reception encouraged five thousand
      warriors to embark with their families in seventeen vessels, and
      the infant power of hengist was fortified by this strong and
      seasonable reenforcement. the crafty barbarian suggested to
      vortigern the obvious advantage of fixing, in the neighborhood of
      the picts, a colony of faithful allies: a third fleet of forty
      ships, under the command of his son and nephew, sailed from
      germany, ravaged the orkneys, and disembarked a new army on the
      coast of northumberland, or lothian, at the opposite extremity of
      the devoted land. it was easy to foresee, but it was impossible
      to prevent, the impending evils. the two nations were soon
      divided and exasperated by mutual jealousies. the saxons
      magnified all that they had done and suffered in the cause of an
      ungrateful people; while the britons regretted the liberal
      rewards which could not satisfy the avarice of those haughty
      mercenaries. the causes of fear and hatred were inflamed into an
      irreconcilable quarrel. the saxons flew to arms; and if they
      perpetrated a treacherous massacre during the security of a
      feast, they destroyed the reciprocal confidence which sustains
      the intercourse of peace and war. 129

      the rash attempt to embody them in an epic poem, called samor,
      commenced at eton, and finished before he had arrived at the
      maturer taste of manhood.m.]

      hengist, who boldly aspired to the conquest of britain, exhorted
      his countrymen to embrace the glorious opportunity: he painted in
      lively colors the fertility of the soil, the wealth of the
      cities, the pusillanimous temper of the natives, and the
      convenient situation of a spacious solitary island, accessible on
      all sides to the saxon fleets. the successive colonies which
      issued, in the period of a century, from the mouths of the elbe,
      the weser, and the rhine, were principally composed of three
      valiant tribes or nations of germany; the jutes, the old saxons,
      and the angles. the jutes, who fought under the peculiar banner
      of hengist, assumed the merit of leading their countrymen in the
      paths of glory, and of erecting, in kent, the first independent
      kingdom. the fame of the enterprise was attributed to the
      primitive saxons; and the common laws and language of the
      conquerors are described by the national appellation of a people,
      which, at the end of four hundred years, produced the first
      monarchs of south britain. the angles were distinguished by their
      numbers and their success; and they claimed the honor of fixing a
      perpetual name on the country, of which they occupied the most
      ample portion. the barbarians, who followed the hopes of rapine
      either on the land or sea, were insensibly blended with this
      triple confederacy; the frisians, who had been tempted by their
      vicinity to the british shores, might balance, during a short
      space, the strength and reputation of the native saxons; the
      danes, the prussians, the rugians, are faintly described; and
      some adventurous huns, who had wandered as far as the baltic,
      might embark on board the german vessels, for the conquest of a
      new world. 130 but this arduous achievement was not prepared or
      executed by the union of national powers. each intrepid
      chieftain, according to the measure of his fame and fortunes,
      assembled his followers; equipped a fleet of three, or perhaps of
      sixty, vessels; chose the place of the attack; and conducted his
      subsequent operations according to the events of the war, and the
      dictates of his private interest. in the invasion of britain many
      heroes vanquished and fell; but only seven victorious leaders
      assumed, or at least maintained, the title of kings. seven
      independent thrones, the saxon heptarchy, 1301 were founded by
      the conquerors, and seven families, one of which has been
      continued, by female succession, to our present sovereign,
      derived their equal and sacred lineage from woden, the god of
      war. it has been pretended, that this republic of kings was
      moderated by a general council and a supreme magistrate. but such
      an artificial scheme of policy is repugnant to the rude and

      a monk, who, in the profound ignorance of human life, has
      presumed to exercise the office of historian, strangely
      disfigures the state of britain at the time of its separation
      from the western empire. gildas 132 describes in florid language
      the improvements of agriculture, the foreign trade which flowed
      with every tide into the thames and the severn the solid and
      lofty construction of public and private edifices; he accuses the
      sinful luxury of the british people; of a people, according to
      the same writer, ignorant of the most simple arts, and incapable,
      without the aid of the romans, of providing walls of stone, or
      weapons of iron, for the defence of their native land. 133 under
      the long dominion of the emperors, britain had been insensibly
      moulded into the elegant and servile form of a roman province,
      whose safety was intrusted to a foreign power. the subjects of
      honorius contemplated their new freedom with surprise and terror;
      they were left destitute of any civil or military constitution;
      and their uncertain rulers wanted either skill, or courage, or
      authority, to direct the public force against the common enemy.
      the introduction of the saxons betrayed their internal weakness,
      and degraded the character both of the prince and people. their
      consternation magnified the danger; the want of union diminished
      their resources; and the madness of civil factions was more
      solicitous to accuse, than to remedy, the evils, which they
      imputed to the misconduct of their adversaries.

      yet the britons were not ignorant, they could not be ignorant, of
      the manufacture or the use of arms; the successive and disorderly
      attacks of the saxons allowed them to recover from their
      amazement, and the prosperous or adverse events of the war added
      discipline and experience to their native valor.

      while the continent of europe and africa yielded, without
      resistance, to the barbarians, the british island, alone and
      unaided, maintained a long, a vigorous, though an unsuccessful,
      struggle, against the formidable pirates, who, almost at the same
      instant, assaulted the northern, the eastern, and the southern
      coasts. the cities which had been fortified with skill, were
      defended with resolution; the advantages of ground, hills,
      forests, and morasses, were diligently improved by the
      inhabitants; the conquest of each district was purchased with
      blood; and the defeats of the saxons are strongly attested by the
      discreet silence of their annalist. hengist might hope to achieve
      the conquest of britain; but his ambition, in an active reign of
      thirty-five years, was confined to the possession of kent; and
      the numerous colony which he had planted in the north, was
      extirpated by the sword of the britons. the monarchy of the west
      saxons was laboriously founded by the persevering efforts of
      three martial generations. the life of cerdic, one of the bravest
      of the children of woden, was consumed in the conquest of
      hampshire, and the isle of wight; and the loss which he sustained
      in the battle of mount badon, reduced him to a state of
      inglorious repose. kenric, his valiant son, advanced into
      wiltshire; besieged salisbury, at that time seated on a
      commanding eminence; and vanquished an army which advanced to the
      relief of the city. in the subsequent battle of marlborough, 134
      his british enemies displayed their military science. their
      troops were formed in three lines; each line consisted of three
      distinct bodies, and the cavalry, the archers, and the pikemen,
      were distributed according to the principles of roman tactics.
      the saxons charged in one weighty column, boldly encountered with
      their shord swords the long lances of the britons, and maintained
      an equal conflict till the approach of night. two decisive
      victories, the death of three british kings, and the reduction of
      cirencester, bath, and gloucester, established the fame and power
      of ceaulin, the grandson of cerdic, who carried his victorious
      arms to the banks of the severn.

      characteristic; and the historians of the twelfth century might
      consult some materials that no longer exist.] after a war of a
      hundred years, the independent britons still occupied the whole
      extent of the western coast, from the wall of antoninus to the
      extreme promontory of cornwall; and the principal cities of the
      inland country still opposed the arms of the barbarians.
      resistance became more languid, as the number and boldness of the
      assailants continually increased. winning their way by slow and
      painful efforts, the saxons, the angles, and their various
      confederates, advanced from the north, from the east, and from
      the south, till their victorious banners were united in the
      centre of the island. beyond the severn the britons still
      asserted their national freedom, which survived the heptarchy,
      and even the monarchy, of the saxons. the bravest warriors, who
      preferred exile to slavery, found a secure refuge in the
      mountains of wales: the reluctant submission of cornwall was
      delayed for some ages; 135 and a band of fugitives acquired a
      settlement in gaul, by their own valor, or the liberality of the
      merovingian kings. 136 the western angle of armorica acquired the
      new appellations of cornwall, and the lesser britain; and the
      vacant lands of the osismii were filled by a strange people, who,
      under the authority of their counts and bishops, preserved the
      laws and language of their ancestors. to the feeble descendants
      of clovis and charlemagne, the britons of armorica refused the
      customary tribute, subdued the neighboring dioceses of vannes,

      chapter xxxviii: reign of clovis.part v.

      in a century of perpetual, or at least implacable, war, much
      courage, and some skill, must have been exerted for the defence
      of britain. yet if the memory of its champions is almost buried
      in oblivion, we need not repine; since every age, however
      destitute of science or virtue, sufficiently abounds with acts of
      blood and military renown. the tomb of vortimer, the son of
      vortigern, was erected on the margin of the sea-shore, as a
      landmark formidable to the saxons, whom he had thrice vanquished
      in the fields of kent. ambrosius aurelian was descended from a
      noble family of romans; 138 his modesty was equal to his valor,
      and his valor, till the last fatal action, 139 was crowned with
      splendid success. but every british name is effaced by the
      illustrious name of arthur, 140 the hereditary prince of the
      silures, in south wales, and the elective king or general of the
      nation. according to the most rational account, he defeated, in
      twelve successive battles, the angles of the north, and the
      saxons of the west; but the declining age of the hero was
      imbittered by popular ingratitude and domestic misfortunes. the
      events of his life are less interesting than the singular
      revolutions of his fame. during a period of five hundred years
      the tradition of his exploits was preserved, and rudely
      embellished, by the obscure bards of wales and armorica, who were
      odious to the saxons, and unknown to the rest of mankind. the
      pride and curiosity of the norman conquerors prompted them to
      inquire into the ancient history of britain: they listened with
      fond credulity to the tale of arthur, and eagerly applauded the
      merit of a prince who had triumphed over the saxons, their common
      enemies. his romance, transcribed in the latin of jeffrey of
      monmouth, and afterwards translated into the fashionable idiom of
      the times, was enriched with the various, though incoherent,
      ornaments which were familiar to the experience, the learning, or
      the fancy, of the twelfth century. the progress of a phrygian
      colony, from the tyber to the thames, was easily ingrafted on the
      fable of the aeneid; and the royal ancestors of arthur derived
      their origin from troy, and claimed their alliance with the
      caesars. his trophies were decorated with captive provinces and
      imperial titles; and his danish victories avenged the recent
      injuries of his country. the gallantry and superstition of the
      british hero, his feasts and tournaments, and the memorable
      institution of his knights of the round table, were faithfully
      copied from the reigning manners of chivalry; and the fabulous
      exploits of uthers son appear less incredible than the
      adventures which were achieved by the enterprising valor of the
      normans. pilgrimage, and the holy wars, introduced into europe
      the specious miracles of arabian magic. fairies and giants,
      flying dragons, and enchanted palaces, were blended with the more
      simple fictions of the west; and the fate of britain depended on
      the art, or the predictions, of merlin. every nation embraced and
      adorned the popular romance of arthur, and the knights of the
      round table: their names were celebrated in greece and italy; and
      the voluminous tales of sir lancelot and sir tristram were
      devoutly studied by the princes and nobles, who disregarded the
      genuine heroes and historians of antiquity. at length the light
      of science and reason was rekindled; the talisman was broken; the
      visionary fabric melted into air; and by a natural, though
      unjust, reverse of the public opinion, the severity of the
      present age is inclined to question the existence of arthur. 141

      resistance, if it cannot avert, must increase the miseries of
      conquest; and conquest has never appeared more dreadful and
      destructive than in the hands of the saxons; who hated the valor
      of their enemies, disdained the faith of treaties, and violated,
      without remorse, the most sacred objects of the christian
      worship. the fields of battle might be traced, almost in every
      district, by monuments of bones; the fragments of falling towers
      were stained with blood; the last of the britons, without
      distinction of age or sex, was massacred, 142 in the ruins of
      anderida; 143 and the repetition of such calamities was frequent
      and familiar under the saxon heptarchy. the arts and religion,
      the laws and language, which the romans had so carefully planted
      in britain, were extirpated by their barbarous successors. after
      the destruction of the principal churches, the bishops, who had
      declined the crown of martyrdom, retired with the holy relics
      into wales and armorica; the remains of their flocks were left
      destitute of any spiritual food; the practice, and even the
      remembrance, of christianity were abolished; and the british
      clergy might obtain some comfort from the damnation of the
      idolatrous strangers. the kings of france maintained the
      privileges of their roman subjects; but the ferocious saxons
      trampled on the laws of rome, and of the emperors. the
      proceedings of civil and criminal jurisdiction, the titles of
      honor, the forms of office, the ranks of society, and even the
      domestic rights of marriage, testament, and inheritance, were
      finally suppressed; and the indiscriminate crowd of noble and
      plebeian slaves was governed by the traditionary customs, which
      had been coarsely framed for the shepherds and pirates of
      germany. the language of science, of business, and of
      conversation, which had been introduced by the romans, was lost
      in the general desolation. a sufficient number of latin or celtic
      words might be assumed by the germans, to express their new wants
      and ideas; 144 but those illiterate pagans preserved and
      established the use of their national dialect. 145 almost every
      name, conspicuous either in the church or state, reveals its
      teutonic origin; 146 and the geography of england was universally
      inscribed with foreign characters and appellations. the example
      of a revolution, so rapid and so complete, may not easily be
      found; but it will excite a probable suspicion, that the arts of
      rome were less deeply rooted in britain than in gaul or spain;
      and that the native rudeness of the country and its inhabitants
      was covered by a thin varnish of italian manners.

      this strange alteration has persuaded historians, and even
      philosophers, that the provincials of britain were totally
      exterminated; and that the vacant land was again peopled by the
      perpetual influx, and rapid increase, of the german colonies.
      three hundred thousand saxons are said to have obeyed the summons
      of hengist; 147 the entire emigation of the angles was attested,
      in the age of bede, by the solitude of their native country; 148
      and our experience has shown the free propagation of the human
      race, if they are cast on a fruitful wilderness, where their
      steps are unconfined, and their subsistence is plentiful. the
      saxon kingdoms displayed the face of recent discovery and
      cultivation; the towns were small, the villages were distant; the
      husbandry was languid and unskilful; four sheep were equivalent
      to an acre of the best land; 149 an ample space of wood and
      morass was resigned to the vague dominion of nature; and the
      modern bishopric of durham, the whole territory from the tyne to
      the tees, had returned to its primitive state of a savage and
      solitary forest. 150 such imperfect population might have been
      supplied, in some generations, by the english colonies; but
      neither reason nor facts can justify the unnatural supposition,
      that the saxons of britain remained alone in the desert which
      they had subdued. after the sanguinary barbarians had secured
      their dominion, and gratified their revenge, it was their
      interest to preserve the peasants as well as the cattle, of the
      unresisting country. in each successive revolution, the patient
      herd becomes the property of its new masters; and the salutary
      compact of food and labor is silently ratified by their mutual
      necessities. wilfrid, the apostle of sussex, 151 accepted from
      his royal convert the gift of the peninsula of selsey, near
      chichester, with the persons and property of its inhabitants, who
      then amounted to eighty-seven families. he released them at once
      from spiritual and temporal bondage; and two hundred and fifty
      slaves of both sexes were baptized by their indulgent master. the
      kingdom of sussex, which spread from the sea to the thames,
      contained seven thousand families; twelve hundred were ascribed
      to the isle of wight; and, if we multiply this vague computation,
      it may seem probable, that england was cultivated by a million of
      servants, or villains, who were attached to the estates of their
      arbitrary landlords. the indigent barbarians were often tempted
      to sell their children, or themselves into perpetual, and even

      granted to national slaves, 153 sufficiently declare that they
      were much less numerous than the strangers and captives, who had
      lost their liberty, or changed their masters, by the accidents of
      war. when time and religion had mitigated the fierce spirit of
      the anglo-saxons, the laws encouraged the frequent practice of
      manumission; and their subjects, of welsh or cambrian extraction,
      assumed the respectable station of inferior freemen, possessed of
      lands, and entitled to the rights of civil society. 154 such
      gentle treatment might secure the allegiance of a fierce people,
      who had been recently subdued on the confines of wales and
      cornwall. the sage ina, the legislator of wessex, united the two
      nations in the bands of domestic alliance; and four british lords

      the independent britons appear to have relapsed into the state of
      original barbarism, from whence they had been imperfectly
      reclaimed. separated by their enemies from the rest of mankind,
      they soon became an object of scandal and abhorrence to the
      catholic world. 156 christianity was still professed in the
      mountains of wales; but the rude schismatics, in the form of the
      clerical tonsure, and in the day of the celebration of easter,
      obstinately resisted the imperious mandates of the roman
      pontiffs. the use of the latin language was insensibly abolished,
      and the britons were deprived of the art and learning which italy
      communicated to her saxon proselytes. in wales and armorica, the
      celtic tongue, the native idiom of the west, was preserved and
      propagated; and the bards, who had been the companions of the
      druids, were still protected, in the sixteenth century, by the
      laws of elizabeth. their chief, a respectable officer of the
      courts of pengwern, or aberfraw, or caermarthen, accompanied the
      kings servants to war: the monarchy of the britons, which he
      sung in the front of battle, excited their courage, and justified
      their depredations; and the songster claimed for his legitimate
      prize the fairest heifer of the spoil. his subordinate ministers,
      the masters and disciples of vocal and instrumental music,
      visited, in their respective circuits, the royal, the noble, and
      the plebeian houses; and the public poverty, almost exhausted by
      the clergy, was oppressed by the importunate demands of the
      bards. their rank and merit were ascertained by solemn trials,
      and the strong belief of supernatural inspiration exalted the
      fancy of the poet, and of his audience. 157 the last retreats of
      celtic freedom, the extreme territories of gaul and britain, were
      less adapted to agriculture than to pasturage: the wealth of the
      britons consisted in their flocks and herds; milk and flesh were
      their ordinary food; and bread was sometimes esteemed, or
      rejected, as a foreign luxury. liberty had peopled the mountains
      of wales and the morasses of armorica; but their populousness has
      been maliciously ascribed to the loose practice of polygamy; and
      the houses of these licentious barbarians have been supposed to
      contain ten wives, and perhaps fifty children. 158 their
      disposition was rash and choleric; they were bold in action and
      in speech; 159 and as they were ignorant of the arts of peace,
      they alternately indulged their passions in foreign and domestic
      war. the cavalry of armorica, the spearmen of gwent, and the
      archers of merioneth, were equally formidable; but their poverty
      could seldom procure either shields or helmets; and the
      inconvenient weight would have retarded the speed and agility of
      their desultory operations. one of the greatest of the english
      monarchs was requested to satisfy the curiosity of a greek
      emperor concerning the state of britain; and henry ii. could
      assert, from his personal experience, that wales was inhabited by
      a race of naked warriors, who encountered, without fear, the

      by the revolution of britain, the limits of science, as well as
      of empire, were contracted. the dark cloud, which had been
      cleared by the phoenician discoveries, and finally dispelled by
      the arms of caesar, again settled on the shores of the atlantic,
      and a roman province was again lost among the fabulous islands of
      the ocean. one hundred and fifty years after the reign of
      honorius, the gravest historian of the times 161 describes the
      wonders of a remote isle, whose eastern and western parts are
      divided by an antique wall, the boundary of life and death, or,
      more properly, of truth and fiction. the east is a fair country,
      inhabited by a civilized people: the air is healthy, the waters
      are pure and plentiful, and the earth yields her regular and
      fruitful increase. in the west, beyond the wall, the air is
      infectious and mortal; the ground is covered with serpents; and
      this dreary solitude is the region of departed spirits, who are
      transported from the opposite shores in substantial boats, and by
      living rowers. some families of fishermen, the subjects of the
      franks, are excused from tribute, in consideration of the
      mysterious office which is performed by these charons of the
      ocean. each in his turn is summoned, at the hour of midnight, to
      hear the voices, and even the names, of the ghosts: he is
      sensible of their weight, and he feels himself impelled by an
      unknown, but irresistible power. after this dream of fancy, we
      read with astonishment, that the name of this island is brittia;
      that it lies in the ocean, against the mouth of the rhine, and
      less than thirty miles from the continent; that it is possessed
      by three nations, the frisians, the angles, and the britons; and
      that some angles had appeared at constantinople, in the train of
      the french ambassadors. from these ambassadors procopius might be
      informed of a singular, though not improbable, adventure, which
      announces the spirit, rather than the delicacy, of an english
      heroine. she had been betrothed to radiger, king of the varni, a
      tribe of germans who touched the ocean and the rhine; but the
      perfidious lover was tempted, by motives of policy, to prefer his
      fathers widow, the sister of theodebert, king of the franks. 162
      the forsaken princess of the angles, instead of bewailing,
      revenged her disgrace. her warlike subjects are said to have been
      ignorant of the use, and even of the form, of a horse; but she
      boldly sailed from britain to the mouth of the rhine, with a
      fleet of four hundred ships, and an army of one hundred thousand
      men. after the loss of a battle, the captive radiger implored the
      mercy of his victorious bride, who generously pardoned his
      offence, dismissed her rival, and compelled the king of the varni
      to discharge with honor and fidelity the duties of a husband. 163
      this gallant exploit appears to be the last naval enterprise of
      the anglo-saxons. the arts of navigation, by which they acquired
      the empire of britain and of the sea, were soon neglected by the
      indolent barbarians, who supinely renounced all the commercial
      advantages of their insular situation. seven independent kingdoms
      were agitated by perpetual discord; and the british world was
      seldom connected, either in peace or war, with the nations of the
      continent. 164

      i have now accomplished the laborious narrative of the decline
      and fall of the roman empire, from the fortunate age of trajan
      and the antonines, to its total extinction in the west, about
      five centuries after the christian era. at that unhappy period,
      the saxons fiercely struggled with the natives for the possession
      of britain: gaul and spain were divided between the powerful
      monarchies of the franks and visigoths, and the dependent
      kingdoms of the suevi and burgundians: africa was exposed to the
      cruel persecution of the vandals, and the savage insults of the
      moors: rome and italy, as far as the banks of the danube, were
      afflicted by an army of barbarian mercenaries, whose lawless
      tyranny was succeeded by the reign of theodoric the ostrogoth.
      all the subjects of the empire, who, by the use of the latin
      language, more particularly deserved the name and privileges of
      romans, were oppressed by the disgrace and calamities of foreign
      conquest; and the victorious nations of germany established a new
      system of manners and government in the western countries of
      europe. the majesty of rome was faintly represented by the
      princes of constantinople, the feeble and imaginary successors of
      augustus. yet they continued to reign over the east, from the
      danube to the nile and tigris; the gothic and vandal kingdoms of
      italy and africa were subverted by the arms of justinian; and the
      history of the greek emperors may still afford a long series of
      instructive lessons, and interesting revolutions.




      chapter xxxviii: reign of clovis.part vi.

    general observations on the fall of the roman empire in the west.

      the greeks, after their country had been reduced into a province,
      imputed the triumphs of rome, not to the merit, but to the
      fortune, of the republic. the inconstant goddess, who so blindly
      distributes and resumes her favors, had now consented (such was
      the language of envious flattery) to resign her wings, to descend
      from her globe, and to fix her firm and immutable throne on the
      banks of the tyber. 1000 a wiser greek, who has composed, with a
      philosophic spirit, the memorable history of his own times,
      deprived his countrymen of this vain and delusive comfort, by
      opening to their view the deep foundations of the greatness of
      rome. 2000 the fidelity of the citizens to each other, and to the
      state, was confirmed by the habits of education, and the
      prejudices of religion. honor, as well as virtue, was the
      principle of the republic; the ambitious citizens labored to
      deserve the solemn glories of a triumph; and the ardor of the
      roman youth was kindled into active emulation, as often as they
      beheld the domestic images of their ancestors. 3000 the temperate
      struggles of the patricians and plebeians had finally established
      the firm and equal balance of the constitution; which united the
      freedom of popular assemblies, with the authority and wisdom of a
      senate, and the executive powers of a regal magistrate. when the
      consul displayed the standard of the republic, each citizen bound
      himself, by the obligation of an oath, to draw his sword in the
      cause of his country, till he had discharged the sacred duty by a
      military service of ten years. this wise institution continually
      poured into the field the rising generations of freemen and
      soldiers; and their numbers were reenforced by the warlike and
      populous states of italy, who, after a brave resistance, had
      yielded to the valor and embraced the alliance, of the romans.
      the sage historian, who excited the virtue of the younger scipio,
      and beheld the ruin of carthage, 4000 has accurately described
      their military system; their levies, arms, exercises,
      subordination, marches, encampments; and the invincible legion,
      superior in active strength to the macedonian phalanx of philip
      and alexander. from these institutions of peace and war polybius
      has deduced the spirit and success of a people, incapable of
      fear, and impatient of repose. the ambitious design of conquest,
      which might have been defeated by the seasonable conspiracy of
      mankind, was attempted and achieved; and the perpetual violation
      of justice was maintained by the political virtues of prudence
      and courage. the arms of the republic, sometimes vanquished in
      battle, always victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to
      the euphrates, the danube, the rhine, and the ocean; and the
      images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to
      represent the nations and their kings, were successively broken
      by the iron monarchy of rome. 5000

      in bellis civilibus et adversus diversas nationes, aliarum
      gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus, (opera, tom. v. p. 572.)]

      the rise of a city, which swelled into an empire, may deserve, as
      a singular prodigy, the reflection of a philosophic mind. but the
      decline of rome was the natural and inevitable effect of
      immoderate greatness. prosperity ripened the principle of decay;
      the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest;
      and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial
      supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its
      own weight. the story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and
      instead of inquiring why the roman empire was destroyed, we
      should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. the
      victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of
      strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the
      republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. the
      emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace,
      were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline
      which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to
      the enemy; the vigor of the military government was relaxed, and
      finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of constantine;
      and the roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of barbarians.

      the decay of rome has been frequently ascribed to the translation
      of the seat of empire; but this history has already shown, that
      the powers of government were divided, rather than removed. the
      throne of constantinople was erected in the east; while the west
      was still possessed by a series of emperors who held their
      residence in italy, and claimed their equal inheritance of the
      legions and provinces. this dangerous novelty impaired the
      strength, and fomented the vices, of a double reign: the
      instruments of an oppressive and arbitrary system were
      multiplied; and a vain emulation of luxury, not of merit, was
      introduced and supported between the degenerate successors of
      theodosius. extreme distress, which unites the virtue of a free
      people, imbitters the factions of a declining monarchy. the
      hostile favorites of arcadius and honorius betrayed the republic
      to its common enemies; and the byzantine court beheld with
      indifference, perhaps with pleasure, the disgrace of rome, the
      misfortunes of italy, and the loss of the west. under the
      succeeding reigns, the alliance of the two empires was restored;
      but the aid of the oriental romans was tardy, doubtful, and
      ineffectual; and the national schism of the greeks and latins was
      enlarged by the perpetual difference of language and manners, of
      interests, and even of religion. yet the salutary event approved
      in some measure the judgment of constantine. during a long period
      of decay, his impregnable city repelled the victorious armies of
      barbarians, protected the wealth of asia, and commanded, both in
      peace and war, the important straits which connect the euxine and
      mediterranean seas. the foundation of constantinople more
      essentially contributed to the preservation of the east, than to
      the ruin of the west.

      as the happiness of a future life is the great object of
      religion, we may hear without surprise or scandal, that the
      introduction or at least the abuse, of christianity had some
      influence on the decline and fall of the roman empire. the clergy
      successfully preached the doctrines of patience and
      pusillanimity: the active virtues of society were discouraged;
      and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the
      cloister: a large portion of public and private wealth was
      consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and
      the soldiers pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both
      sexes, who could only plead the merits of abstinence and
      chastity. 511 faith, zeal, curiosity, and the more earthly
      passions of malice and ambition, kindled the flame of theological
      discord; the church, and even the state, were distracted by
      religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody, and
      always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted
      from camps to synods; the roman world was oppressed by a new
      species of tyranny; and the persecuted sects became the secret
      enemies of their country. yet party spirit, however pernicious or
      absurd, is a principle of union as well as of dissension. the
      bishops, from eighteen hundred pulpits, inculcated the duty of
      passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign; their
      frequent assemblies, and perpetual correspondence, maintained the
      communion of distant churches; and the benevolent temper of the
      gospel was strengthened, though confined, by the spiritual
      alliance of the catholics. the sacred indolence of the monks was
      devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age; but if
      superstition had not afforded a decent retreat, the same vices
      would have tempted the unworthy romans to desert, from baser
      motives, the standard of the republic. religious precepts are
      easily obeyed, which indulge and sanctify the natural
      inclinations of their votaries; but the pure and genuine
      influence of christianity may be traced in its beneficial, though
      imperfect, effects on the barbarian proselytes of the north. if
      the decline of the roman empire was hastened by the conversion of
      constantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the
      fall, and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors.

      511 (return) [ it might be a curious speculation, how far the
      purer morals of the genuine and more active christians may have
      compensated, in the population of the roman empire, for the
      secession of such numbers into inactive and unproductive
      celibacy.m.]

      this awful revolution may be usefully applied to the instruction
      of the present age. it is the duty of a patriot to prefer and
      promote the exclusive interest and glory of his native country:
      but a philosopher may be permitted to enlarge his views, and to
      consider europe as one great republic whose various inhabitants
      have obtained almost the same level of politeness and
      cultivation. the balance of power will continue to fluctuate, and
      the prosperity of our own, or the neighboring kingdoms, may be
      alternately exalted or depressed; but these partial events cannot
      essentially injure our general state of happiness, the system of
      arts, and laws, and manners, which so advantageously distinguish,
      above the rest of mankind, the europeans and their colonies. the
      savage nations of the globe are the common enemies of civilized
      society; and we may inquire, with anxious curiosity, whether
      europe is still threatened with a repetition of those calamities,
      which formerly oppressed the arms and institutions of rome.
      perhaps the same reflections will illustrate the fall of that
      mighty empire, and explain the probable causes of our actual
      security.

      i. the romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger, and
      the number of their enemies. beyond the rhine and danube, the
      northern countries of europe and asia were filled with
      innumerable tribes of hunters and shepherds, poor, voracious, and
      turbulent; bold in arms, and impatient to ravish the fruits of
      industry. the barbarian world was agitated by the rapid impulse
      of war; and the peace of gaul or italy was shaken by the distant
      revolutions of china. the huns, who fled before a victorious
      enemy, directed their march towards the west; and the torrent was
      swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies. the
      flying tribes who yielded to the huns assumed in their turn the
      spirit of conquest; the endless column of barbarians pressed on
      the roman empire with accumulated weight; and, if the foremost
      were destroyed, the vacant space was instantly replenished by new
      assailants. such formidable emigrations can no longer issue from
      the north; and the long repose, which has been imputed to the
      decrease of population, is the happy consequence of the progress
      of arts and agriculture. instead of some rude villages, thinly
      scattered among its woods and morasses, germany now produces a
      list of two thousand three hundred walled towns: the christian
      kingdoms of denmark, sweden, and poland, have been successively
      established; and the hanse merchants, with the teutonic knights,
      have extended their colonies along the coast of the baltic, as
      far as the gulf of finland. from the gulf of finland to the
      eastern ocean, russia now assumes the form of a powerful and
      civilized empire. the plough, the loom, and the forge, are
      introduced on the banks of the volga, the oby, and the lena; and
      the fiercest of the tartar hordes have been taught to tremble and
      obey. the reign of independent barbarism is now contracted to a
      narrow span; and the remnant of calmucks or uzbecks, whose forces
      may be almost numbered, cannot seriously excite the apprehensions
      of the great republic of europe. 6000 yet this apparent security
      should not tempt us to forget, that new enemies, and unknown
      dangers, may possibly arise from some obscure people, scarcely
      visible in the map of the world, the arabs or saracens, who
      spread their conquests from india to spain, had languished in
      poverty and contempt, till mahomet breathed into those savage
      bodies the soul of enthusiasm.

      6000 (return) [ the french and english editors of the
      genealogical history of the tartars have subjoined a curious,
      though imperfect, description, of their present state. we might
      question the independence of the calmucks, or eluths, since they
      have been recently vanquished by the chinese, who, in the year
      1759, subdued the lesser bucharia, and advanced into the country
      of badakshan, near the source of the oxus, (memoires sur les
      chinois, tom. i. p. 325-400.) but these conquests are precarious,
      nor will i venture to insure the safety of the chinese empire.]

      ii. the empire of rome was firmly established by the singular and
      perfect coalition of its members. the subject nations, resigning
      the hope, and even the wish, of independence, embraced the
      character of roman citizens; and the provinces of the west were
      reluctantly torn by the barbarians from the bosom of their mother
      country. 7000 but this union was purchased by the loss of
      national freedom and military spirit; and the servile provinces,
      destitute of life and motion, expected their safety from the
      mercenary troops and governors, who were directed by the orders
      of a distant court. the happiness of a hundred millions depended
      on the personal merit of one or two men, perhaps children, whose
      minds were corrupted by education, luxury, and despotic power.
      the deepest wounds were inflicted on the empire during the
      minorities of the sons and grandsons of theodosius; and, after
      those incapable princes seemed to attain the age of manhood, they
      abandoned the church to the bishops, the state to the eunuchs,
      and the provinces to the barbarians. europe is now divided into
      twelve powerful, though unequal kingdoms, three respectable
      commonwealths, and a variety of smaller, though independent,
      states: the chances of royal and ministerial talents are
      multiplied, at least, with the number of its rulers; and a
      julian, or semiramis, may reign in the north, while arcadius and
      honorius again slumber on the thrones of the south. the abuses of
      tyranny are restrained by the mutual influence of fear and shame;
      republics have acquired order and stability; monarchies have
      imbibed the principles of freedom, or, at least, of moderation;
      and some sense of honor and justice is introduced into the most
      defective constitutions by the general manners of the times. in
      peace, the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated by
      the emulation of so many active rivals: in war, the european
      forces are exercised by temperate and undecisive contests. if a
      savage conqueror should issue from the deserts of tartary, he
      must repeatedly vanquish the robust peasants of russia, the
      numerous armies of germany, the gallant nobles of france, and the
      intrepid freemen of britain; who, perhaps, might confederate for
      their common defence. should the victorious barbarians carry
      slavery and desolation as far as the atlantic ocean, ten thousand
      vessels would transport beyond their pursuit the remains of
      civilized society; and europe would revive and flourish in the
      american world, which is already filled with her colonies and
      institutions. 8000

      7000 (return) [ the prudent reader will determine how far this
      general proposition is weakened by the revolt of the isaurians,
      the independence of britain and armorica, the moorish tribes, or
      the bagaudae of gaul and spain, (vol. i. p. 328, vol. iii. p.
      315, vol. iii. p. 372, 480.)]

      8000 (return) [ america now contains about six millions of
      european blood and descent; and their numbers, at least in the
      north, are continually increasing. whatever may be the changes of
      their political situation, they must preserve the manners of
      europe; and we may reflect with some pleasure, that the english
      language will probably be diffused ever an immense and populous
      continent.]

      iii. cold, poverty, and a life of danger and fatigue, fortify the
      strength and courage of barbarians. in every age they have
      oppressed the polite and peaceful nations of china, india, and
      persia, who neglected, and still neglect, to counterbalance these
      natural powers by the resources of military art. the warlike
      states of antiquity, greece, macedonia, and rome, educated a race
      of soldiers; exercised their bodies, disciplined their courage,
      multiplied their forces by regular evolutions, and converted the
      iron, which they possessed, into strong and serviceable weapons.
      but this superiority insensibly declined with their laws and
      manners; and the feeble policy of constantine and his successors
      armed and instructed, for the ruin of the empire, the rude valor
      of the barbarian mercenaries. the military art has been changed
      by the invention of gunpowder; which enables man to command the
      two most powerful agents of nature, air and fire. mathematics,
      chemistry, mechanics, architecture, have been applied to the
      service of war; and the adverse parties oppose to each other the
      most elaborate modes of attack and of defence. historians may
      indignantly observe, that the preparations of a siege would found
      and maintain a flourishing colony; 9000 yet we cannot be
      displeased, that the subversion of a city should be a work of
      cost and difficulty; or that an industrious people should be
      protected by those arts, which survive and supply the decay of
      military virtue. cannon and fortifications now form an
      impregnable barrier against the tartar horse; and europe is
      secure from any future irruptions of barbarians; since, before
      they can conquer, they must cease to be barbarous. their gradual
      advances in the science of war would always be accompanied, as we
      may learn from the example of russia, with a proportionable
      improvement in the arts of peace and civil policy; and they
      themselves must deserve a place among the polished nations whom
      they subdue.

      9000 (return) [ on avoit fait venir (for the siege of turin) 140
      pieces de canon; et il est a remarquer que chaque gros canon
      monte revient a environ ecus: il y avoit 100,000 boulets; 106,000
      cartouches dune facon, et 300,000 dune autre; 21,000 bombes;
      27,700 grenades, 15,000 sacs a terre, 30,000 instruments pour la
      pionnage; 1,200,000 livres de poudre. ajoutez a ces munitions, le
      plomb, le fer, et le fer-blanc, les cordages, tout ce qui sert
      aux mineurs, le souphre, le salpetre, les outils de toute espece.

      destruction suffiroient pour fonder et pour faire fleurir la plus
      aombreuse colonie. voltaire, siecle de louis xiv. c. xx. in his
      works. tom. xi. p. 391.]

      should these speculations be found doubtful or fallacious, there
      still remains a more humble source of comfort and hope. the
      discoveries of ancient and modern navigators, and the domestic
      history, or tradition, of the most enlightened nations, represent
      the human savage, naked both in body and mind and destitute of
      laws, of arts, of ideas, and almost of language. 1001 from this
      abject condition, perhaps the primitive and universal state of
      man, he has gradually arisen to command the animals, to fertilize
      the earth, to traverse the ocean and to measure the heavens. his
      progress in the improvement and exercise of his mental and
      corporeal faculties 1101 has been irregular and various;
      infinitely slow in the beginning, and increasing by degrees with
      redoubled velocity: ages of laborious ascent have been followed
      by a moment of rapid downfall; and the several climates of the
      globe have felt the vicissitudes of light and darkness. yet the
      experience of four thousand years should enlarge our hopes, and
      diminish our apprehensions: we cannot determine to what height
      the human species may aspire in their advances towards
      perfection; but it may safely be presumed, that no people, unless
      the face of nature is changed, will relapse into their original
      barbarism. the improvements of society may be viewed under a
      threefold aspect. 1. the poet or philosopher illustrates his age
      and country by the efforts of a single mind; but those superior
      powers of reason or fancy are rare and spontaneous productions;
      and the genius of homer, or cicero, or newton, would excite less
      admiration, if they could be created by the will of a prince, or
      the lessons of a preceptor. 2. the benefits of law and policy, of
      trade and manufactures, of arts and sciences, are more solid and
      permanent: and many individuals may be qualified, by education
      and discipline, to promote, in their respective stations, the
      interest of the community. but this general order is the effect
      of skill and labor; and the complex machinery may be decayed by
      time, or injured by violence.

      3. fortunately for mankind, the more useful, or, at least, more
      necessary arts, can be performed without superior talents, or
      national subordination: without the powers of one, or the union
      of many. each village, each family, each individual, must always
      possess both ability and inclination to perpetuate the use of
      fire 1201 and of metals; the propagation and service of domestic
      animals; the methods of hunting and fishing; the rudiments of
      navigation; the imperfect cultivation of corn, or other nutritive
      grain; and the simple practice of the mechanic trades. private
      genius and public industry may be extirpated; but these hardy
      plants survive the tempest, and strike an everlasting root into
      the most unfavorable soil. the splendid days of augustus and
      trajan were eclipsed by a cloud of ignorance; and the barbarians
      subverted the laws and palaces of rome. but the scythe, the
      invention or emblem of saturn, 1302 still continued annually to
      mow the harvests of italy; and the human feasts of the
      laestrigons 1401 have never been renewed on the coast of
      campania.

      1001 (return) [ it would be an easy, though tedious, task, to
      produce the authorities of poets, philosophers, and historians. i
      shall therefore content myself with appealing to the decisive and

      in his time wandered along the shores of the red sea, can only be

      religious zeal have diffused, among the savages of the old and
      new world, these inestimable gifts: they have been successively
      propagated; they can never be lost. we may therefore acquiesce in
      the pleasing conclusion, that every age of the world has
      increased, and still increases, the real wealth, the happiness,
      the knowledge, and perhaps the virtue, of the human race. 1501

section 2. information about the mission of project gutenberg-tm

project gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. it
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future
generations. to learn more about the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
sections 3 and 4 and the foundation information page at

section 4. information about donations to the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation

project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states. compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. to send
donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states. u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. to
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

section 5. general information about project gutenberg-tm electronic works

professor michael s. hart was the originator of the project
gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. for forty years, he produced and
distributed project gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the u.s. unless a copyright notice is included. thus, we do not
necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

most people start at our website which has the main pg search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

this website includes information about project gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation, how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks.
