	a (named ? in the english, and most commonly  in other languages). the first letter of the english and of many other alphabets. the capital a of the alphabets of middle and western europe, as also the small letter (a), besides the forms in italic, black letter, etc., are all descended from the old latin a, which was borrowed from the greek alpha, of the same form; and this was made from the first letter (?) of the phoenician alphabet, the equivalent of the hebrew aleph, and itself from the egyptian origin. the aleph was a consonant letter, with a guttural breath sound that was not an element of greek articulation; and the greeks took it to represent their vowel alpha with the  sound, the phoenician alphabet having no vowel symbols.
	this letter, in english, is used for several different vowel sounds. see guide to pronunciation,  4374. the regular long a, as in fate, etc., is a comparatively modern sound, and has taken the place of what, till about the early part of the 17th century, was a sound of the quality of  (as in far).

	a. a, as a prefix to english words, is derived from various sources. (1) it frequently signifies on or in (from an, a forms of as. on), denoting a state, as in afoot, on foot, abed, amiss, asleep, aground, aloft, away (as. onweg), and analogically, ablaze, atremble, etc. (2) as. of off, from, as in adown (as. ofdne off the dun or hill). (3) as. ? (goth. us, ur, ger. er), usually giving an intensive force, and sometimes the sense of away, on, back, as in arise, abide, ago. (4) old english y or i (corrupted from the as. inseparable particle ge, cognate with ohg. ga, gi, goth. ga), which, as a prefix, made no essential addition to the meaning, as in aware. (5) french ... (l. ad to), as in abase, achieve. (6) l. a, ab, abs, from, as in avert. (7) greek insep. prefix ? without, or privative, not, as in abyss, atheist; akin to e. un.

	4. (mar. law) to relinquish all claim to;  used when an insured person gives up to underwriters all claim to the property covered by a policy, which may remain after loss or damage by a peril insured against.
	syn. to give up; yield; forego; cede; surrender; resign; abdicate; quit; relinquish; renounce; desert; forsake; leave; retire; withdraw from.  to abandon, desert, forsake. these words agree in representing a person as giving up or leaving some object, but differ as to the mode of doing it. the distinctive sense of abandon is that of giving up a thing absolutely and finally; as, to abandon one's friends, places, opinions, good or evil habits, a hopeless enterprise, a shipwrecked vessel. abandon is more widely applicable than forsake or desert. the latin original of desert appears to have been originally applied to the case of deserters from military service. hence, the verb, when used of persons in the active voice, has usually or always a bad sense, implying some breach of fidelity, honor, etc., the leaving of something which the person should rightfully stand by and support; as, to desert one's colors, to desert one's post, to desert one's principles or duty. when used in the passive, the sense is not necessarily bad; as, the fields were deserted, a deserted village, deserted halls. forsake implies the breaking off of previous habit, association, personal connection, or that the thing left had been familiar or frequented; as, to forsake old friends, to forsake the paths of rectitude, the blood forsook his cheeks. it may be used either in a good or in a bad sense.
	aibandon, n. [f. abandon. fr. abandonner. see abandon, v.] abandonment; relinquishment. [obs.]
	abandon (?), n. [f. see abandon.] a complete giving up to natural impulses; freedom from artificial constraint; careless freedom or ease.

	syn. profligate; dissolute; corrupt; vicious; depraved; reprobate; wicked; unprincipled; graceless; vile.  abandoned, profligate, reprobate. these adjectives agree in expressing the idea of great personal depravity. profligate has reference to open and shameless immoralities, either in private life or political conduct; as, a profligate court, a profligate ministry. abandoned is stronger, and has reference to the searing of conscience and hardening of heart produced by a man's giving himself wholly up to iniquity; as, a man of abandoned character. reprobate describes the condition of one who has become insensible to reproof, and who is morally abandoned and lost beyond hope of recovery.
	 god gave them over to a reprobate mind.

	whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased.
luke xiv.ll.
	syn. to abase, debase, degrade. these words agree in the idea of bringing down from a higher to a lower state. abase has reference to a bringing down in condition or feelings; as to abase one's self before god. debase has reference to the bringing down of a thing in purity, or making it base. it is, therefore, always used in a bad sense, as, to debase the coin of the kingdom, to debase the mind by vicious indulgence, to debase one's style by coarse or vulgar expressions. degrade has reference to a bringing down from some higher grade or from some standard. thus, a priest is degraded from the clerical office. when used in a moral sense, it denotes a bringing down in character and just estimation; as, degraded by intemperance, a degrading employment, etc. 12art is degraded when it is regarded only as a trade. 
	aibased (?), a. 1. lowered; humbled.
	2. (her.) [f. abaiss.] borne lower than usual, as a fess; also, having the ends of the wings turned downward towards the point of the shield.

	aibaser (?), n. he who, or that which, abases.
	aibash (?), v.t. [imp. & p.p. abashed (?); p.pr. & vb. n. abashing.] [oe. abaissen, abaisshen, abashen, of.esbahir, f. bahir, to astonish, fr. l. ex + the interjection bah, expressing astonishment. in oe. somewhat confused with abase. cf. finish.] to destroy the selfpossession of; to confuse or confound, as by exciting suddenly a consciousness of guilt, mistake, or inferiority; to put to shame; to disconcert; to discomfit.
	abashed, the devil stood,
	and felt how awful goodness is.
milton.
	he was a man whom no check could abash.
macaulay.
	syn. to confuse; confound; disconcert; shame.  to abash, confuse, confound. abash is a stronger word than confuse, but not so strong as confound. we are abashed when struck either with sudden shame or with a humbling sense of inferiority; as, peter was abashed in the presence of those who are greatly his superiors. we are confused when, from some unexpected or startling occurrence, we lose clearness of thought and selfpossession. thus, a witness is often confused by a severe crossexamination; a timid person is apt to be confused in entering a room full of strangers. we are confounded when our minds are overwhelmed, as it were, by something wholly unexpected, amazing, dreadful, etc., so that we have nothing to say. thus, a criminal is usually confounded at the discovery of his guilt.
	satan stood
	awhile as mute, confounded what to say.

	6. (law) (a) to bring entirely down or put an end to; to do away with; as, to abate a nuisance, to abate a writ. (b) (eng. law) to diminish; to reduce. legacies are liable to be abated entirely or in proportion, upon a deficiency of assets.

	to abate into a freehold, to abate in lands (law), to enter into a freehold after the death of the last possessor, and before the heir takes possession. see abatement, 4.
	syn. to subside; decrease; intermit; decline; diminish; lessen.  to abate, subside. these words, as here compared, imply a coming down from some previously raised or exited state. abate expresses this in respect to degrees, and implies a diminution of force or of intensity; as, the storm abates, the cold abates, the force of the wind abates; or, the wind abates, a fever abates. subside (to settle down) has reference to a previous state of agitation or commotion; as, the waves subside after a storm, the wind subsides into a calm. when the words are used figuratively, the same distinction should be observed. if we conceive of a thing as having different degrees of intensity or strength, the word to be used is abate. thus we say, a man's anger abates, the ardor of one's love abates, 12winter rage abates . but if the image be that of a sinking down into quiet from preceding excitement or commotion, the word to be used is subside; as, the tumult of the people subsides, the public mind subsided into a calm. the same is the case with those emotions which are tumultuous in their nature; as, his passion subsides, his joy quickly subsided, his grief subsided into a pleasing melancholy. yet if, in such cases, we were thinking of the degree of violence of the emotion, we might use abate; as, his joy will abate in the progress of time; and so in other instances.

syn.  to abolish, repeal, abrogate, revoke, annul, nullify, cancel. these words have in common the idea of setting aside by some overruling act. abolish applies particularly to things of a permanent nature, such as institutions, usages, customs, etc.; as, to abolish monopolies, serfdom, slavery. repeal describes the act by which the legislature of a state sets aside a law which it had previously enacted. abrogate was originally applied to the repeal of a law by the roman people; and hence, when the power of making laws was usurped by the emperors, the term was applied to their act of setting aside the laws. thus it came to express that act by which a sovereign or an executive government sets aside laws, ordinances, regulations, treaties, conventions, etc. revoke denotes the act or recalling some previous grant which conferred, privilege, etc.; as, to revoke a decree, to revoke a power of attorney, a promise, etc. thus, also, we speak of the revocation of the edict of nantes. annul is used in a more general sense, denoting simply to make void; as, to annul a contract, to annul an agreement. nullify is an old word revived in this country, and applied to the setting of things aside either by force or by total disregard; as, to nullify an act of congress. cancel is to strike out or annul, by a deliberate exercise of power, something which has operative force.

syn. - to deck; decorate; embellish; ornament; beautify; grace; dignify; exalt; honor. - to adorn, ornament, decorate, embellish. we decorate and ornament by putting on some adjunct which is attractive or beautiful, and which serves to heighten the general effect. thus, a lady's head-dress may be ornament or decorated with flowers or jewelry; a hall may be decorated or ornament with carving or gilding, with wreaths of flowers, or with hangings. ornament is used in a wider sense than decorate. to embellish is to beautify or ornament richly, not so much by mere additions or details as by modifying the thing itself as a whole. it sometimes means gaudy and artificial decoration. we embellish a book with rich engravings; a style is embellished with rich and beautiful imagery; a shopkeeper embellishes his front window to attract attention. adorn is sometimes identical with decorate, as when we say, a lady was adorned with jewels. in other cases, it seems to imply something more. thus, we speak of a gallery of paintings as adorned with the works of some of the great masters, or adorned with noble statuary and columns. here decorated and ornamented would hardly be appropriate. there is a value in these works of genius beyond mere show and ornament. adorn may be used of what is purely moral; as, a character adorned with every christian grace. here neither decorate, nor ornament, nor embellish is proper.

syn.  calamity; sorrow; distress; grief; pain; adversity; misery; wretchedness; misfortune; trouble; hardship.  affliction, sorrow, grief, distress. affliction and sorrow are terms of wide and general application; grief and distress have reference to particular cases. affliction is the stronger term. the suffering lies deeper in the soul, and usually arises from some powerful cause, such as the loss of what is most dear  friends, health, etc. we do not speak of mere sickness or pain as 12an affliction,  though one who suffers from either is said to be afflicted; but deprivations of every kind, such as deafness, blindness, loss of limbs, etc., are called afflictions, showing that term applies particularly to prolonged sources of suffering. sorrow and grief are much alike in meaning, but grief is the stronger term of the two, usually denoting poignant mental suffering for some definite cause, as, grief for the death of a dear friend; sorrow is more reflective, and is tinged with regret, as, the misconduct of a child is looked upon with sorrow. grief is often violent and demonstrative; sorrow deep and brooding. distress implies extreme suffering, either bodily or mental. in its higher stages, it denotes pain of a restless, agitating kind, and almost always supposes some struggle of mind or body. affliction is allayed, grief subsides, sorrow is soothed, distress is mitigated.

this word, not only in popular language, but in the scriptures, often signifies, indefinitely, a large portion or number, or a great part. thus, all the cattle in egypt died, all judea and all the region round about jordan, all men held john as a prophet, are not to be understood in a literal sense, but as including a large part, or very great numbers.

all to, or allto. in such phrases as 12all to rent,  all to break,  12allto frozen,  etc., which are of frequent occurrence in our old authors, the all and the to have commonly been regarded as forming a compound adverb, equivalent in meaning to entirely, completely, altogether. but the sense of entireness lies wholly in the word all (as it does in 12all forlorn,  and similar expressions), and the to properly belongs to the following word, being a kind of intensive prefix (orig. meaning asunder and answering to the lg. teri, hg. zeri). it is frequently to be met with in old books, used without the all. thus wyclif says, 12the vail of the temple was to rent:  and of judas, 12he was hanged and toburst the middle:  i. e., burst in two, or asunder.  all along. see under along.  all and some, individually and collectively, one and all.

syn. - excuse. an apology, in the original sense of the word, was a pleading off from some charge or imputation, by explaining and defending one's principles or conduct. it therefore amounted to a vindication. one who offers an apology, admits himself to have been, at least apparently, in the wrong, but brings forward some palliating circumstance, or tenders a frank acknowledgment, by way of reparation. we make an apology for some breach of propriety or decorum (like rude expressions, unbecoming conduct, etc.), or some deficiency in what might be reasonably expected. we offer an excuse when we have been guilty of some breach or neglect of duty; and we do it by way of extenuating our fault, and with a view to be forgiven. when an excuse has been accepted, an apology may still, in some cases, be necessary or appropriate. 12an excuse is not grounded on the claim of innocence, but is rather an appeal for favor resting on some collateral circumstance. an apology mostly respects the conduct of individuals toward each other as equals; it is a voluntary act produced by feelings of decorum, or a desire for the good opinion of others.

syn. - to appreciate, estimate, esteem. estimate is an act of judgment; esteem is an act of valuing or prizing, and when applied to individuals, denotes a sentiment of moral approbation. see estimate. appreciate lies between the two. as compared with estimate, it supposes a union of sensibility with judgment, producing a nice and delicate perception. as compared with esteem, it denotes a valuation of things according to their appropriate and distinctive excellence, and not simply their moral worth. thus, with reference to the former of these (delicate perception), an able writer says. 12women have a truer appreciation of character than men;  and another remarks, 12it is difficult to appreciate the true force and distinctive sense of terms which we are every day using.  so, also, we speak of the difference between two things, as sometimes hardly appreciable. with reference to the latter of these (that of valuation as the result of a nice perception), we say, 12it requires a pe??liar cast of character to appreciate the poetry of wordsworth;  12he who has no delicacy himself, can  not appreciate it in others;  12the thought of death is salutary, because it leads us to appreciate worldly things aright.  appreciate is much used in cases where something is in danger of being overlooked or undervalued; as when we speak of appreciating the difficulties of a subject, or the risk of an undertaking. so lord plunket, referring to an 12ominous silence  which prevailed among the irish peasantry, says, 12if you knew now to appreciate that silence, it is more formidable than the most clamorous opposition.  in like manner, a person who asks some favor of another is apt to say, 12i trust you will appreciate my motives in this request.  here we have the key to a very frequent use of the word. it is hardly necessary to say that appreciate looks on the favorable side of things. we never speak of appreciating a man's faults, but his merits. this idea of regarding things favorably appears more fully in the word appreciative; as when we speak of an appreciative audience, or an appreciative review, meaning one that manifests a quick perception and a ready valuation of excellence.

project gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  it exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future generations.

section 4.  information about donations to the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation

project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states.  compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  to
send donations or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states.  u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
to donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


section 5.  general information about project gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

professor michael s. hart is the originator of the project gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  for thirty years, he produced and distributed project
gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s.
unless a copyright notice is included.  thus, we do not necessarily
keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


most people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

this web site includes information about project gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation, how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks.
